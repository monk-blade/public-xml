This tearDown part can be useful for multiple reasons, such as freeing up resources that have been allocated, closing files that are no longer being read from (or written to), and even quitting browsers that were spun up for automated testing.</p><p>Creating them is simple. Let&#39;s create a simple context manager that displays the runtime of a code block:</p><p>```pythonimport timefrom contextlib import contextmanager</p><p>@contextmanagerdef print_runtime(description=&quot;Code block&quot;):    start_time = time.time()    try:        yield    finally:        runtime = time.time() - start_time        print(f&quot;{description} ran for {runtime:.4f}s.&quot;)```</p><p>Here&#39;s how you could use it as a method decorator:</p><p>```python@print_runtime()def my_function():    # &lt;CODE BLOCK&gt;</p><p>my_function()```</p><p>Here&#39;s how you could use it within a function using the <code>with</code> keyword:</p><p><code>pythonwith print_runtime():    # &lt;CODE BLOCK&gt;</code></p><p>And here&#39;s a low-level way to use it without the <code>with</code> keyword:</p><p>```pythonmy<em>context = print_runtime()my_object = my_context.</em><em>enter</em>_()</p><h1>&lt;CODE BLOCK&gt;</h1><p>my<em>context.</em><em>exit</em>_(None, None, None)```</p><p>As you can see, it&#39;s easy to create and use Python context managers. You can even pass args into them when configured for that. In advanced scenarios, you might even use context managers for browser automation. Example:</p><p>```pythonfrom seleniumbase import SB</p><p>with SB(incognito=True, demo=True, test=True) as sb:    sb.open(&quot;<a href="https://www.saucedemo.com%22">https://www.saucedemo.com&quot;</a>)    sb.type(&quot;#user-name&quot;, &quot;standard_user&quot;)    sb.type(&quot;#password&quot;, &quot;secret_sauce&quot;)    sb.click(&quot;#login-button&quot;)    sb.click(&#39;button[name*=&quot;backpack&quot;]&#39;)    sb.click(&quot;#shopping_cart_container a&quot;)    sb.assert_text(&quot;Backpack&quot;, &quot;div.cart_item&quot;)```</p><p>That was a simple example of testing an e-commerce site. There were a few args passed into the context manager on initialization, such as <code>incognito</code> for Chrome&#39;s Incognito Mode, <code>demo</code> to highlight browser actions, and <code>test</code> to display additional info for testing, such as runtime.</p><p>Whether you&#39;re looking to do simple File I/O, or more advanced things such as browser automation, Python context managers can be extremely useful!</p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section><section class='separator separator-before-comments'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='comments'><p>Top comments</p><ol><li><div class="md"><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython">r/learnpython</a></p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1nld9qx/python_context_managers_101/nf4tfbx/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><div class="md"><p>You show how to create a context manager and jump straight into using it as a decorator?</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1nld9qx/python_context_managers_101/nf51c8u/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><div class="md"><p>TIL contextmanager functions can be used as decorators!</p><p>But agreed with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/Natural-Intelligence">u/Natural-Intelligence</a>, my advice would be to figure out the primary goal of your post first and focus on that.

But first, let me explain what this whole &quot;Signals&quot; thing is about.</p><h1>I built Signals = Excel for your Python code</h1><p>You know that frustrating bug where you update some data but forget to refresh the UI? Or where you change one piece of state and suddenly everything is inconsistent? <strong>I got tired of those bugs, so I built something that eliminates them completely.</strong></p><p>Signals work just like Excel - change one cell, and all dependent formulas automatically recalculate:</p><pre><code>from reaktiv import Signal, Computed, Effect# Your data (like Excel cells)name = Signal(&quot;Alice&quot;)age = Signal(25)# Automatic formulas (like Excel =A1&amp;&quot; is &quot;&amp;B1&amp;&quot; years old&quot;)greeting = Computed(lambda: f&quot;{name()} is {age()} years old&quot;)# Auto-display (like Excel charts that update automatically)display = Effect(lambda: print(greeting()))# Prints: &quot;Alice is 25 years old&quot;# Just change the data - everything updates automatically!name.set(&quot;Bob&quot;)  # Prints: &quot;Bob is 25 years old&quot;age.set(30)      # Prints: &quot;Bob is 30 years old&quot;</code></pre><p><strong>No more forgotten updates. No more inconsistent state. It just works.</strong></p><h1>What I just added: LinkedSignals</h1><p>The big feature I&#39;m excited about in v0.19.2 is <strong>LinkedSignals</strong> - for when you want a value that usually follows a formula, but users can override it temporarily:</p><pre><code>from reaktiv import Signal, Computed, LinkedSignal# Items from your APIitems = Signal([&quot;iPhone&quot;, &quot;Samsung&quot;, &quot;Google Pixel&quot;])# Selection that defaults to first item but remembers user choiceselected = LinkedSignal(lambda: items()[0] if items() else None)print(selected())  # &quot;iPhone&quot;# User picks somethingselected.set(&quot;Samsung&quot;) print(selected())  # &quot;Samsung&quot;# API updates - smart behavior!items.set([&quot;Samsung&quot;, &quot;OnePlus&quot;, &quot;Nothing Phone&quot;])print(selected())  # Still &quot;Samsung&quot; (preserved!)# But resets when their choice is goneitems.set([&quot;OnePlus&quot;, &quot;Nothing Phone&quot;])print(selected())  # &quot;OnePlus&quot; (smart fallback)</code></pre><p><strong>I built this for:</strong></p><ul><li>Search/filter UIs where selections should survive data refreshes</li><li>Pagination that clamps to valid pages automatically</li><li>Form defaults that adapt but remember user input</li><li>Any &quot;smart defaulting&quot; scenario</li></ul><h1>Why I think this matters</h1><p>The traditional approach:</p><pre><code># Update data ✓# Remember to update display (bug!)  # Remember to validate selection (bug!)# Remember to update related calculations (bug!)</code></pre><p>So I built something where you declare relationships once:</p><pre><code># Declare what depends on what# Everything else happens automatically ✓</code></pre><p>I borrowed this battle-tested pattern from frontend frameworks (Angular, SolidJS) and brought it to Python. Perfect for APIs, data processing, configuration management, or any app where data flows through your system.</p><p>Try it out: <code>pip install reaktiv</code> (now v0.19.2!)</p><p><a href="https://github.com/buiapp/reaktiv">GitHub</a> | <a href="https://reaktiv.readthedocs.io">Docs</a> | <a href="https://github.com/buiapp/reaktiv/tree/main/examples">Examples</a> | <a href="https://reaktiv.bui.app/#interactive-demo">Playground</a></p><p>Would love to hear what you think or if you build something cool with it!</p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section><section class='separator separator-before-comments'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='comments'><p>Top comments</p><ol><li><div class="md"><p>Neat, this is kinda like Jane Street’s ocaml library Incremental.

I&#39;d like to show off a neat side project I&#39;ve been working on- a Pips/Dominoes puzzle solver!<br/>I got the idea for this after doing some Leetcode problems and wondering what the most optimized way would be to tackle this type of puzzle. If you&#39;re unfamiliar with this game, check out Pips on the NYTGames site- there&#39;s 3 free puzzles every day.</p><p><strong>TARGET AUDIENCE:</strong><br/>Anyone interested in Pips/Dominoes puzzles, and wants more than just the daily puzzles provided by NYTGames. This is meant as a non-commercial toy project designed to give myself and others more to do with Pips.</p><p><strong>Comparison:</strong><br/>To my knowledge, the only other resource similar to this project is <a href="http://PipsGame.io">PipsGame.io</a>, but they&#39;re closed-source compared to my project. And as mentioned, NYTGames runs the official game on their website, but currently their site doesn&#39;t provide an archive or more than 3 daily puzzles to do.</p><p><strong>What My Project Does:</strong><br/>My intention was to implement backtracking and BFS to solve this like it was a Leetcode problem: backtracking to recursively place dominoes, and BFS to look for all connected tiles with the same constraint.<br/>The average time to solve a puzzle is 0.059 seconds, although there are some puzzles I&#39;ve encountered- taking entire minutes- that I need to optimize the algorithm for.</p><p>Any suggestions/feedback are appreciated, and I&#39;ve provided my GitHub link if anyone wants to contribute! In the future, I&#39;m hoping to also build a puzzle generator and flesh out this repository as a playable terminal game.</p><p><strong>LINKS:</strong><br/>GitHub Link: <a href="https://github.com/ematth/pips">https://github.com/ematth/pips</a></p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section>]]></description><pubDate>Fri, 19 Sep 2025 20:17:59 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1nl4bxv/a_script_to_get_songs_from_a_playlist_with/</link><title>A script to get songs from a playlist with matching total length</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1nl4bxv/a_script_to_get_songs_from_a_playlist_with/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1nl4bxv/a_script_to_get_songs_from_a_playlist_with/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p>Reading time: 1 min | <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1nl4bxv/a_script_to_get_songs_from_a_playlist_with/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='separator separator-after-permalink'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='selftext'><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><h1>What my project does</h1><p>Basically, you input:</p><ul><li><p>A public youtube playlist</p></li><li><p>Target duration</p></li></ul><p>You get:</p><ul><li>Song groups with a matching total length</li></ul><h1>Target Audience</h1><p>So I think this is one of the most specific &#39;problems&#39;..</p><p>I&#39;ve been making a slow return to jogging, and one of the changes to keep things fresh was to jog until the playlist ended.

Right before I made this post, I made the repository public.  You can find it <a href="https://gitlab.com/evansemenoff/enso">here.</a></p><h1>What my project does</h1><p>enso is a high-level functional framework that works over top of Python.  It expands the existing Python syntax by adding a variety of features.  It does so by altering the AST at runtime, expanding the functionality of a handful of built-in classes, and using a modified tokenizer which adds additional tokens for a preprocessing/translation step.</p><p>I&#39;ll go over a few of the basic features so that people can get a taste of what you can do with it.</p><ol><li>Automatically curried functions!</li></ol><p>How about the function add, which looks like</p><pre><code>def add(x:a, y:a) -&gt; a:    return x + y</code></pre><p>Unlike normal Python, where you would need to call add with 2 arguments, you can call this <code>add</code> with only one argument, and then call it with the other argument later, like so:</p><pre><code>f = add(2)f(2)4</code></pre><ol><li>A map operator</li></ol><p>Since functions are automatically curried, this makes them really, really easy to use with <code>map</code>.  Fortunately, enso has a map operator, much like Haskell.</p><pre><code>f &lt;$&gt; [1,2,3][3, 4, 5]</code></pre><ol><li>Predicate functions</li></ol><p>Functions that return <code>Bool</code> work a little differently than normal functions.  They are able to use the pipe operator to filter iterables:</p><pre><code>even? | [1,2,3,4][2, 4]</code></pre><ol><li>Function composition</li></ol><p>There are a variety of ways that functions can be composed in enso, the most common one is your typical function composition.</p><pre><code>h = add(2) @ mul(2)h(3)8</code></pre><p>Additionally, you can take the <em>direct sum</em> of 2 functions:</p><pre><code>h = add + mulh(1,2,3,4)(3, 12)</code></pre><p>And these are just a few of the ways in which you can combine functions in enso.</p><ol><li>Macros</li></ol><p>enso has a variety of macro styles, allowing you to redefine the syntax on the file, adding new operators, regex based macros, or even complex syntax operations.  For example, in the REPL, you can add a <code>zip</code> operator like so:</p><pre><code>macro(op(&quot;-=-&quot;, zip))[1,2,3] -=- [4,5,6][(1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6)]</code></pre><p>This is just one style of macro that you can add, see the readme in the project for more.</p><ol><li>Monads, more new operators, new methods on existing classes, tons of useful functions, automatically derived function &#39;variants&#39;, and loads of other features made to make writing code fun, ergonomic and aesthetic.</li></ol><p>Above is just a small taster of the features I&#39;ve added.  The README file in the repo goes over a lot more.</p><h1>Target Audience</h1><p>What I&#39;m hoping is that people will enjoy this.  I&#39;ve been working on it for awhile, and dogfooding my own work by writing several programs in it.  My own smart-home software is written entirely in <em>enso.</em>  I&#39;m really happy to be able to share what is essentially a beta version of it, and would be super happy if people were interested in contributing, or even just using enso and filing bug reports.  My long shot goal is that one day I will write a proper compiler for enso, and either self-host it as its own language, or run it on something like LLVM and avoid some of the performance issues from Python, as well as some of the sticky parts which have been a little harder to work with.</p><p>I will post this to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/functionalprogramming">r/functionalprogramming</a> once I have obtained enough karma.</p><p>Happy coding.</p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section><section class='separator separator-before-comments'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='comments'><p>Top comments</p><ol><li><div class="md"><p>Please feel free to ask any questions about <em>enso</em> here.

As someone who makes liberal use of <code>functools</code>, I’ll definitely be checking this out in the morning — just the ability to write <code>fn = add(1)</code> rather than <code>fn = ft.partial(add, 1)</code> is already a HUGE selling point!

The CLI reads your type hints to understand what AWS resources you need, then generates CloudFormation templates automatically and deploys to your own AWS account. You will still be using the official AWS libraries so migration will be seamless by just adding a few lines of code.</p><p>Right now the framework is only focused on Python CRON jobs but planning to expand to other use cases.</p><p>We&#39;re looking for honest feedback on a few things. Does this approach feel natural in Python, or does it seem forced? How does this compare to your current deployment workflow? Is migration to this approach easy? What other AWS resources would be most useful to have supported? Do you have any concerns about mixing infrastructure definitions with application code?</p><p>This is experimental - we&#39;re trying to understand if IfC patterns that work well in Rust translate effectively to Python. The Python deployment ecosystem already has great tools, so we want to know if this adds value or just complexity.</p><p><strong>Resources:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.shuttle.dev/blog/2025/09/18/introducing-shuttle-cobra?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=shuttle_cobra_launch">Full Article</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/shuttle-hq/shuttle-cobra">GitHub Repository</a></li><li><a href="https://docs.cobra.shuttle.dev/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=python_cobra_feedback">Shuttle Cobra Docs</a></li></ul><p>Thanks for any feedback - positive or negative.

The reason I like terraform, for example, is that it&#39;s a language with syntax highlighting, validation, modules, logic, types, validation, etc., as opposed to, for example a bunch of yaml (like cloud formation templates), which is less maintainable IMO. For me to feel comfortable defining infra within code, I think I&#39;d  like to have the following things:</p><ul><li><p>Some easy-to-consume representation of the system (via CLI I guess), so I can understand the big picture ... and diffing against the current state</p></li><li><p>feedback in the editor / ide / CI whenever anything is misconfigured -- type checks, validation, etc... something that might be challenging is that python is by-default dynamic (though many of us might wish it weren&#39;t the case), so there&#39;s probably a limit to how many developers would benefit from extensive type hints, for example</p></li><li><p>some separation between config for deployment and my app -- i.e. I don&#39;t think I want infra environment variables to be visible by my program</p></li></ul><p>I&#39;m thinking-via-keystrokes here, so not sure how helpful this will be -- I&#39;d never considered doing infra like this.

Can be expanded to support other tools, like ruff, black, etc.<br/>- Use direnv to automatically activate the environment when you change to a folder (or windows equivalent).<br/>- If you write a lot of scripts with dependencies that you use in many folders (i.e. where an .venv isn&#39;t handy), use the script support of uv to automatically set up dependencies.

It uses a novel algorithm to achieve best in class performance.</p><p><strong>Target audience:</strong><br/>This package is particularly suitable for iterative weighted selection from an evolving population, such as a simulation. One example is repeated churn and acquisition of customers with a simulation to determine the customer base evolution over time.</p><p><strong>Comparison:</strong><br/>There are naive algorithms, often O(N) or worse. State of the art algorithms like Walker&#39;s alias method can do O(1) selection, but require an O(N) setup and is not suitable for evolving populations. Fenwick trees are also often used, with O(log N) complexity for selection and addition. <code>DigitBinIndex</code> is O(P) for both, where P is the fixed precision.</p><p>Here&#39;s an excerpt from a

tomlev</code></p><p><strong>Benefits:</strong>- Automatic type conversion and validation- Environment variable substitution with defaults- Zero dependencies, production-ready- Perfect IDE and AI assistant support</p><h2>The Problem</h2><p>PEP 735 style config management leads to repetitive, error-prone code:</p><p>```python</p><h1>The old way - manual parsing everywhere</h1><p>DB_HOST = os.getenv(&quot;DB_HOST&quot;, &quot;localhost&quot;)DB_PORT = int(os.getenv(&quot;DB_PORT&quot;, &quot;5432&quot;))  # Hope this doesn&#39;t crash!DEBUG = os.getenv(&quot;DEBUG&quot;, &quot;false&quot;).lower() == &quot;true&quot;  # Boolean hell```</p><h2>What My Project Does</h2><p>TomlEv reads TOML files with environment variable substitution and validates them against typed Python classes:</p><p>```pythonfrom tomlev import BaseConfigModel, TomlEv</p><p>class DatabaseConfig(BaseConfigModel):    host: str    port: int    user: str</p><p>class AppConfig(BaseConfigModel):    debug: bool    database: DatabaseConfig</p><h1>One line - fully type-safe!</h1><p>config: AppConfig = TomlEv(AppConfig).validate()```</p><p><strong>TOML file:</strong>```tomldebug = &quot;${DEBUG|-false}&quot;</p><p>[database]host = &quot;${DB_HOST|-localhost}&quot;port = &quot;${DB_PORT|-5432}&quot;user = &quot;${DB_USER}&quot;```</p><p>Works as CLI too:<code>bashtomlev validate --toml app.toml --env-file .envtomlev render --toml app.toml &gt; config.json</code></p><h2>Target Audience</h2><p>Python developers using modern type hints who want reliable configuration management without the boilerplate.</p><h2>Comparison</h2><p>❌ <strong>python-dotenv</strong>: No type safety, manual parsing❌ <strong>pydantic-settings</strong>: More complex, less TOML-focused❌ <strong>configparser</strong>: INI format, no modern Python features❌ <strong>YAML configs</strong>: Security issues, complex parsing</p><p>✅ <strong>TomlEv</strong>: TOML readability + Python type safety + environment flexibility</p><p><strong>Similar tools:</strong>- No direct equivalent for TOML + type safety + env substitution</p><h2>Try it out: <a

It&#39;s not just a set of helpers; it&#39;s a complete foundation for authentication, authorization, and session management. Out of the box, it gives you:</p><ul><li><strong>Fully async</strong> operations built on SQLAlchemy 2.0.</li><li><strong>Hierarchical RBAC</strong> for complex, nested permissions (e.g., <code>Organization -&gt; Project -&gt; Resource</code>), which goes beyond simple roles.</li><li><strong>Secure, server-side sessions</strong> with built-in hijack detection.</li><li>A familiar developer experience using standard FastAPI <code>Depends</code> and Pydantic models.</li></ul><h1>Target Audience</h1><p>This is built for Python developers using FastAPI to create <strong>production-grade applications</strong>. It&#39;s specifically useful for projects that need more complex, granular authorization logic, like multi-tenant SaaS platforms, internal dashboards, or any app where users have different levels of access to specific resources. It is not a toy project and is running in our own production environment.</p><h1>Comparison</h1><p>I built this because I needed a specific combination of features that I couldn&#39;t find together in other libraries.</p><ul><li><strong>vs. FastAPI&#39;s built-in tools:</strong> The built-in security utilities are great low-level primitives. AuthTuna is a higher-level, &quot;batteries-included&quot; framework. You get pre-built user flows, session management, and a full permission system instead of having to build them yourself on top of the primitives.</li><li><strong>vs. FastAPI-Users:</strong> FastAPI-Users is an excellent, popular library. AuthTuna differs mainly in its focus on <strong>hierarchical permissions</strong> and its <strong>session model</strong>. If you need to model complex, multi-level access rules (not just &quot;admin&quot; or &quot;user&quot;) and prefer the security model of stateful, server-side sessions over stateless JWTs, then AuthTuna is a better fit.</li></ul><p>The code is up on GitHub, and feedback is welcome.</p><p><strong>GitHub:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/shashstormer/authtuna"><code>https://github.com/shashstormer/authtuna</code></a></p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section><section class='separator separator-before-comments'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='comments'><p>Top comment</p><ol><li><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone, just a quick update.</p><p>To help build more trust and confidence in the library, I&#39;ve spent today focused on increasing the test coverage.</p><p>Happy to share that the project is now at <strong>83% coverage</strong>, up from 56% yesterday.</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1nhn589/i_built_authtuna_a_modern_asyncfirst_security/nejzm6u/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p></li></ol></section>]]></description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 19:49:20 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1nhl0t6/i_build_typesafe_toml_configuration_with/</link><title>I Build Type-safe TOML configuration with environment variables for Python 3.11+ | TomlEv</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1nhl0t6/i_build_typesafe_toml_configuration_with/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1nhl0t6/i_build_typesafe_toml_configuration_with/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p>Reading time: 2 min | <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1nhl0t6/i_build_typesafe_toml_configuration_with/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='separator separator-after-permalink'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='selftext'><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Stop fighting with environment variables and manual type conversion - get type-safe TOML configuration that just works.</p><p><code>bashpip install tomlev</code></p><p><strong>Benefits:</strong>- Automatic type conversion and validation- Environment variable substitution with defaults- Zero dependencies, production-ready- Perfect IDE and AI assistant support</p><h2>The Problem</h2><p>PEP 735 style config management leads to repetitive, error-prone code:</p><p>```python</p><h1>The old way - manual parsing everywhere</h1><p>DB_HOST = os.getenv(&quot;DB_HOST&quot;, &quot;localhost&quot;)DB_PORT = int(os.getenv(&quot;DB_PORT&quot;, &quot;5432&quot;))  # Hope this doesn&#39;t crash!DEBUG = os.getenv(&quot;DEBUG&quot;, &quot;false&quot;).lower() == &quot;true&quot;  # Boolean hell```</p><h2>What My Project Does</h2><p>TomlEv reads TOML files with environment variable substitution and validates them against typed Python classes:</p><p>```pythonfrom tomlev import BaseConfigModel, TomlEv</p><p>class DatabaseConfig(BaseConfigModel):    host: str    port: int    user: str</p><p>class AppConfig(BaseConfigModel):    debug: bool    database: DatabaseConfig</p><h1>One line - fully type-safe!</h1><p>config: AppConfig = TomlEv(AppConfig).validate()```</p><p><strong>TOML file:</strong>```tomldebug = &quot;${DEBUG|-false}&quot;</p><p>[database]host = &quot;${DB_HOST|-localhost}&quot;port = &quot;${DB_PORT|-5432}&quot;user = &quot;${DB_USER}&quot;```</p><p>Works as CLI too:<code>bashtomlev validate --toml app.toml --env-file .envtomlev render --toml app.toml &gt; config.json</code></p><h2>Target Audience</h2><p>Python developers using modern type hints who want reliable configuration management without the boilerplate.</p><h2>Comparison</h2><p>❌ <strong>python-dotenv</strong>: No type safety, manual parsing❌ <strong>pydantic-settings</strong>: More complex, less TOML-focused❌ <strong>configparser</strong>: INI format, no modern Python features❌ <strong>YAML configs</strong>: Security issues, complex parsing</p><p>✅ <strong>TomlEv</strong>: TOML readability + Python type safety + environment flexibility</p><p><strong>Similar tools:</strong>- No direct equivalent for TOML + type safety + env substitution</p><h2>Try it out: <a href="https://github.com/thesimj/tomlev">https://github.com/thesimj/tomlev</a></h2><p>⭐ <strong>Star if it helps!</strong> Issues and PRs welcome. ⭐</p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section><section class='separator separator-before-comments'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='comments'><p>Top comment</p><ol><li><div class="md"><p>We should talk and merge projects?

Its algorithm uses spaced repetition and semantic analysis to target your weaknesses and help you learn faster. It started as an SAT tool, but I&#39;ve expanded it for everything, and I have custom flashcard deck suggestions for you guys to learn programming syntax and complex CS topics.</p><p>Hi everyone,</p><p>So, I&#39;m not great at studying, or any good lol. Like when the SATs were coming up in high school, all my friends were getting 1500s, and I was just not, like I couldn&#39;t keep up, and I hated that I couldn&#39;t just sit down and study like them. The only thing I did all day was browse the web and working on coding projects that i would never finish in the first place.</p><p>So, one day, whilst working on a project and contemplating how bad of a person I was for not studying, I decided why not use my only skill, coding, to force me to study.</p><p>At first I wanted to make like a locker that would prevent my from accessing apps until I answered a question, but I only ever open a few apps a day, but what I did do was load hundreds of websites a da, and that&#39;s how the idea flashysurf was born. I didn&#39;t even have a real computer at the time, my laptop broke, so I built the first version as a userscript on my old iPad with a cheap Bluetooth mouse. It basically works like this, it&#39;s a Chrome extension that just randomly pops up with a flashcard every now and then while you&#39;re on YouTube, watching Anime, GitHub, or wherever. You answer it, and you slowly build knowledge without even trying.</p><p>It&#39;s completely free and open source (<a href="https://github.com/MaxDevv/FlashySurf">GitHub link here</a>), and I got a little obsessed with the algorithm  (I&#39;ve been working on this for like 5-6 months now lol). It&#39;s not just random. It uses a combination of psycological techniques to make learning as efficient as possible:</p><ul><li>Dumb Weakness Targeting: Really simple, everytime you get a question wrong, its stored in a list and then later on these quesitons are priorotized that way you work on your weaknesses.</li><li>Intelligent Weakness Targeting: This was one of the biggest updates I made. For my SAT version, I implemented a semantic clustering system that groups questions by topic. So for example, if you get a question about arithmentic wrong, it knows to show you more questions that are semantically similar. Meaning it actively tarkedts your weak areas. The question selection is split 50% new questions, 35% questions similar to ones you&#39;ve failed, and 15% direct review of failed questions.</li><li>Forced Note-Taking: This is in my opinion the most important feature in flashysurf for learning. Basically, if you get a question wrong, you have to write a short note on why you messed up and what you should&#39;ve done instead, before you can close the card. It forces you to actually assess your mistakes and learn from them, instead of just clicking past them.</li></ul><p>At first, it was just for the SAT, and the results were actually really impressive. I personally got my score up 100 points, which is like going from the top 8% to the top 3% (considered a really big improvement), and a lot of my friends and other online users saw 60-100 point increases. So it proved the concept worked, especially for lazy people like me who want to learn without the effort of a formal study session.</p><p>After seeing it work so well, I pushed an update, FlashySurf v2.0, so that anyone can study LITERALLY ANYTHING without having to try. You can create and import your own flashcard decks for any subject.</p><p>The only/biggest caveat about flashysurf is that you need to use it for a bit of time to see results like I used it for 2 months to see that 100 point increase (technically that was an outdated version with far less optimizations, so it should take less time) so you can&#39;t just use it for a test you have tmrw (unless you set it to be like 100% which would mean that a flashcard would appear on every single website).</p><p>It has a few more features that I couldn&#39;t mention here: AI flashcard generation from documents; 30 minute breaks to focus; stats on flashcard collections; and for the SAT, performance reports. (Also if ur wondering why i&#39;m using semicolons, I actually learnt that from studying the SAT using flashysurf lol)</p><p>And for you guys in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/python">r/python</a>, I thought this would be perfect for drilling concepts that just need repetition. So, if you go to the flashysurf <a href="https://flashysurf.com/creator">flashcard creator</a> you can actually use the AI flashcard import/maker tool to convert any documents (i.e. programming problems/exercises you have) or your own flashcard decks into flashysurf flashcards. So you can work on complex programming topics like Big O notation, dynamic programming, and graph theory algorithms. Note: You will obviously need the extension to use the cards lol but when you install the extension, you&#39;ll recieve <a href="https://flashysurf.com/onboarding">instructions</a> on creating and importing flashcards, so you don&#39;t gotta memorize any of this.</p><p>You can download it from the Chrome Web Store, link in the website: <a href="https://flashysurf.com/?utm_source=rpst&amp;utm_campaign=rpython">https://flashysurf.com/</a></p><p>I&#39;m still actively working on it (just pushed a bugfix yesterday lol), so I&#39;d love to hear any feedback or ideas you have. Hope it helps you learn something new while you&#39;re procrastinating on your actual work.</p><p>Thanks for reading :D</p><p>Complicance thingy</p><h1>What My Project Does</h1><p>FlashySurf is a free, open-source Chrome extension that helps users learn and study by showing them flashcards as they browse the web. It uses a spaced repetition algorithm with semantic analysis to identify and target a user&#39;s weaknesses. The extension also has features like a &quot;Forced Note-Taking&quot; system to ensure users learn from their mistakes, and it allows for custom flashcard decks so it can be used for any subject.</p><h1>Target Audience</h1><p>FlashySurf is intended for anyone who wants to learn or study new information without the effort of a formal study session. It is particularly useful for students, professionals, or hobbyists who spend a lot of time on the web and want to use that time more productively. It&#39;s a production-ready project that&#39;s been in development for over six months, with a focus on being a long-term learning tool.</p><h1>Comparison</h1><p>While there are other flashcard and spaced repetition tools, FlashySurf stands out by integrating learning directly into a user&#39;s everyday browsing habits. Unlike traditional apps like Anki, which require dedicated study sessions, FlashySurf brings the flashcards to you. Its unique combination of a spaced repetition algorithm with a semantic clustering system means it not only reinforces what you&#39;ve learned but actively focuses on related topics where you are weakest. This approach is designed to help &quot;lazy&quot; learners like me who struggle with traditional study methods.</p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section><section class='separator separator-before-comments'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='comments'><p>Top comments</p><ol><li><div class="md"><p>This sounds legit.

The program allows single MIDI files or playlists of MIDI files to be loaded and visualised through a command-line tool.</p><p>It&#39;s fairly simple, using Pygame to display the visualiser window and provide playback control, but I&#39;m pretty proud of how it looks and the audio-syncing logic (which uses Mido to interpret MIDI events). More details on how to use it are available in the <a href="https://github.com/benjaminrall/midi-visualiser">project repository</a>.</p><p>This is the first project I&#39;ve used <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/">uv</a> for, and I absolutely love it - check it out if you haven&#39;t already. Also, any suggestions/comments about the project would be greatly appreciated as I&#39;m very new to uploading to PyPI!</p><p>To summarise;- <strong>What My Project Does</strong>: Plays MIDI files and visualises them using a scrolling piano roll- <strong>Target Audience</strong>: Mainly just a toy project, but could be used by anyone who wants a simple &amp; quick way to view any MIDI file!- <strong>Comparison</strong>: I can&#39;t find any alternatives that have this same functionality (at least not made in Python) - it obviously can&#39;t compete with mega fancy MIDI visualisers, but a strong point is how straight forward the project is, working immediately from the command-line without needing any configuration.</p><p>Edit: Thanks to a comment, I&#39;ve discovered an issue that means this only works on Windows - will look into fixing this, sorry!</p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section><section class='separator separator-before-comments'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='comments'><p>Top comments</p><ol><li><div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not real-time.</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1ng9en6/midivisualiser_a_realtime_midi_player_and/ne4dfq8/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><div class="md"><p>Is it like a foss version of Synthesia?

YAML (as per spec) is famously complex and absolute bonkers to parse correctly [and it can cause real security issues that you should be aware of when using YAML]. It&#39;s also (more or less) a superset of JSON so it&#39;s certainly not the simpler of the two.</p><p>That said: it very much depends on what you need and want to do. If I just want &quot;some structured data&quot; that a human might have to interact with: TOML, and it&#39;s not even close. YAML may come in when I need &quot;power&quot; (though at that point I&#39;d heavily consider just foregoing the &quot;config&quot; language in favour of a programming language). And JSON when I may need to process the data with every crummy language under the sun (and can get by without needing integers...)</p><p>EDIT: maybe two projects that are worth mentioning here: <a href="https://github.com/crdoconnor/strictyaml">strictyaml</a> and <a href="https://json5.org/">JSON5</a></p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1ng10wr/the_best_object_notation/ne0lmp3/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><div class="md"><p>Just FYI, the term you want is probably &quot;serialization&quot; not &quot;notation.&quot;</p><p>Having the standard terminology might make searching a bit easier. </p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1ng10wr/the_best_object_notation/ne0rqnq/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><div class="md"><p>A lot of people here are sharing their experience of JSON and YAML as a configuration format. Fewer folks here have used YAML as a data format. I&#39;d ignore those advice especially those suggesting TOML (an amazing config format, a horrible data format).</p><p>In Javascript, the purpose of JSON is a file format that can represent every data type in JS. Since Python dictionary is not the same as JavaScript Object, JSON cannot fully represent a Python dictionary. The Python json module only provides mapping between JSON and SOME native Python types (e.g., string, int, list, dict) and a few key ones are missing (e.g., tuple, enum, set). More importantly, JSON cannot fully represent custom Python data types (e.g., Class objects, C objects like numpy, etc.), while it can for Javascript.</p><p>For that you need a tool that helps you with deserialization to the types not covered.

I wanted something lightweight, easy to use (exploratory), and something that would support numerical methods more easily. Hence, I created this lightweight wrapper that provides a hybrid symbolic-numerical interface to symbolic and numerical backends. It is backward compatible with Sympy. In short, this enables much faster analysis of symbolic math expressions by providing both numerical and traditional symbolic methods of analysis in the same interface. I have also added additional numerical methods that neither SymPy nor SciPy have (Pade approximations, numerical roots, etc.). The main goal for this project is to provide a tool that requires as little of a learning curve as possible and allows them to just focus on the math they are doing.</p><h1>Core features</h1><ul><li><strong>🔒 Operative Closure</strong>: Mathematical operations return new Expression objects by default</li><li><strong>⚡ Mutability Control</strong>: Choose between immutable (default) and mutable expressions for different workflows</li><li><strong>🔗 Seamless Numerical Integration</strong>: Every symbolic expression has a <code>.n</code> attribute providing numerical methods without manual lambdification (uses cached lambdified expression when needed)</li><li><strong>🎨 Enhanced Printing</strong>: Flexible output formatting through the <code>.print</code> attribute (LaTeX, pretty printing, code generation)</li><li><strong>📡 Signal System</strong>: Qt-like signals for tracking expression mutations and clones, enabling reactive programming</li><li><strong>🔄 Automatic Type Conversions</strong>: Seamlessly and automatically converts between internal Poly and Expr representations based on context</li><li><strong>📦 Lightweight</strong>: ~0.5 MB itself, ~100 MB including dependencies</li><li><strong>🧩 Fully backward compatible</strong>: Seamlessly integrate SymPy and MathFlow in the same script.

It would be cool if expressions were lazy and could be collected (like Polars expressions/LazyFrames) when you want to evaluate them numerically. That way the symbolic and numerical expressions could share the same interface.</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1nfyq8o/mathflow_an_easytouse_math_library_for_python/ne2ccvq/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p></li></ol></section>]]></description><pubDate>Sat, 13 Sep 2025 19:51:43 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1nfvo8y/announcing_iceoryx2_v07_fast_and_robust/</link><title>Announcing iceoryx2 v0.7: Fast and Robust Inter-Process Communication (IPC) Library</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1nfvo8y/announcing_iceoryx2_v07_fast_and_robust/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1nfvo8y/announcing_iceoryx2_v07_fast_and_robust/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p>Reading time: 1 min | <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1nfvo8y/announcing_iceoryx2_v07_fast_and_robust/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='separator separator-after-permalink'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='selftext'><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello hello,</p><p>I am one of the maintainers of the open-source zero-copy middleware iceoryx2, and we’ve just released iceoryx2 v0.7 which comes with Python language bindings. That means you can now use fast zero-copy communication directly in Python. Here is the full release blog: <a href="https://ekxide.io/blog/iceoryx2-0-7-release/">https://ekxide.io/blog/iceoryx2-0-7-release/</a></p><p>With iceoryx2 you can communicate between different processes, send data with publish-subscribe, build more complex request-response streams, or orchestrate processes using the event messaging pattern with notifiers and listeners.</p><p>We’ve prepared a set of Python examples here: <a href="https://github.com/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx2/tree/main/examples/python">https://github.com/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx2/tree/main/examples/python</a></p><p>On top of that, we invested some time into writing a detailed getting started guide in the iceoryx2 book: <a href="https://ekxide.github.io/iceoryx2-book/main/getting-started/quickstart.html">https://ekxide.github.io/iceoryx2-book/main/getting-started/quickstart.html</a></p><p>And one more thing: iceoryx2 lets Python talk directly to C, C++ and Rust processes - without any serialization or binding overhead. Check out the cross-language publish-subscribe example to see it in action: <a href="https://github.com/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx2/tree/main/examples">https://github.com/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx2/tree/main/examples</a></p><p>So in short:</p><ul><li><strong>What My Project Does:</strong> Zero-Copy Inter-Process Communication</li><li><strong>Target Audience:</strong> Developers building distributed systems, plugin-based applications, or safety-critical and certifiable systems</li><li><strong>Comparision:</strong> Provides a high-level, service-oriented abstraction over low-level shared memory system calls</li></ul></div><!-- SC_ON --></section><section class='separator separator-before-comments'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='comments'><p>Top comment</p><ol><li><div class="md"><p>Is it possible to use iceoryx2 to make two applications communicate between each other on a k8s cluster?
