It&#39;s not just a set of helpers; it&#39;s a complete foundation for authentication, authorization, and session management. Out of the box, it gives you:</p><ul><li><strong>Fully async</strong> operations built on SQLAlchemy 2.0.</li><li><strong>Hierarchical RBAC</strong> for complex, nested permissions (e.g., <code>Organization -&gt; Project -&gt; Resource</code>), which goes beyond simple roles.</li><li><strong>Secure, server-side sessions</strong> with built-in hijack detection.</li><li>A familiar developer experience using standard FastAPI <code>Depends</code> and Pydantic models.</li></ul><h1>Target Audience</h1><p>This is built for Python developers using FastAPI to create <strong>production-grade applications</strong>. It&#39;s specifically useful for projects that need more complex, granular authorization logic, like multi-tenant SaaS platforms, internal dashboards, or any app where users have different levels of access to specific resources. It is not a toy project and is running in our own production environment.</p><h1>Comparison</h1><p>I built this because I needed a specific combination of features that I couldn&#39;t find together in other libraries.</p><ul><li><strong>vs. FastAPI&#39;s built-in tools:</strong> The built-in security utilities are great low-level primitives. AuthTuna is a higher-level, &quot;batteries-included&quot; framework. You get pre-built user flows, session management, and a full permission system instead of having to build them yourself on top of the primitives.</li><li><strong>vs. FastAPI-Users:</strong> FastAPI-Users is an excellent, popular library. AuthTuna differs mainly in its focus on <strong>hierarchical permissions</strong> and its <strong>session model</strong>. If you need to model complex, multi-level access rules (not just &quot;admin&quot; or &quot;user&quot;) and prefer the security model of stateful, server-side sessions over stateless JWTs, then AuthTuna is a better fit.</li></ul><p>The code is up on GitHub, and feedback is welcome.</p><p><strong>GitHub:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/shashstormer/authtuna"><code>https://github.com/shashstormer/authtuna</code></a></p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section>]]></description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 19:49:20 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1nhfhcs/3_months_in_python_i_made_my_first_proper_2d_game/</link><title>3 months in Python, I made my first proper 2D game</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1nhfhcs/3_months_in_python_i_made_my_first_proper_2d_game/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1nhfhcs/3_months_in_python_i_made_my_first_proper_2d_game/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p>Reading time: 1 min | <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1nhfhcs/3_months_in_python_i_made_my_first_proper_2d_game/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='separator separator-after-permalink'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='selftext'><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><strong>What My Project Does:</strong><br/>I’ve been messing with Python for about three months, mostly tutorials and dumb exercises.

Its algorithm uses spaced repetition and semantic analysis to target your weaknesses and help you learn faster. It started as an SAT tool, but I&#39;ve expanded it for everything, and I have custom flashcard deck suggestions for you guys to learn programming syntax and complex CS topics.</p><p>Hi everyone,</p><p>So, I&#39;m not great at studying, or any good lol. Like when the SATs were coming up in high school, all my friends were getting 1500s, and I was just not, like I couldn&#39;t keep up, and I hated that I couldn&#39;t just sit down and study like them. The only thing I did all day was browse the web and working on coding projects that i would never finish in the first place.</p><p>So, one day, whilst working on a project and contemplating how bad of a person I was for not studying, I decided why not use my only skill, coding, to force me to study.</p><p>At first I wanted to make like a locker that would prevent my from accessing apps until I answered a question, but I only ever open a few apps a day, but what I did do was load hundreds of websites a da, and that&#39;s how the idea flashysurf was born. I didn&#39;t even have a real computer at the time, my laptop broke, so I built the first version as a userscript on my old iPad with a cheap Bluetooth mouse. It basically works like this, it&#39;s a Chrome extension that just randomly pops up with a flashcard every now and then while you&#39;re on YouTube, watching Anime, GitHub, or wherever. You answer it, and you slowly build knowledge without even trying.</p><p>It&#39;s completely free and open source (<a href="https://github.com/MaxDevv/FlashySurf">GitHub link here</a>), and I got a little obsessed with the algorithm  (I&#39;ve been working on this for like 5-6 months now lol). It&#39;s not just random. It uses a combination of psycological techniques to make learning as efficient as possible:</p><ul><li>Dumb Weakness Targeting: Really simple, everytime you get a question wrong, its stored in a list and then later on these quesitons are priorotized that way you work on your weaknesses.</li><li>Intelligent Weakness Targeting: This was one of the biggest updates I made. For my SAT version, I implemented a semantic clustering system that groups questions by topic. So for example, if you get a question about arithmentic wrong, it knows to show you more questions that are semantically similar. Meaning it actively tarkedts your weak areas. The question selection is split 50% new questions, 35% questions similar to ones you&#39;ve failed, and 15% direct review of failed questions.</li><li>Forced Note-Taking: This is in my opinion the most important feature in flashysurf for learning. Basically, if you get a question wrong, you have to write a short note on why you messed up and what you should&#39;ve done instead, before you can close the card. It forces you to actually assess your mistakes and learn from them, instead of just clicking past them.</li></ul><p>At first, it was just for the SAT, and the results were actually really impressive. I personally got my score up 100 points, which is like going from the top 8% to the top 3% (considered a really big improvement), and a lot of my friends and other online users saw 60-100 point increases. So it proved the concept worked, especially for lazy people like me who want to learn without the effort of a formal study session.</p><p>After seeing it work so well, I pushed an update, FlashySurf v2.0, so that anyone can study LITERALLY ANYTHING without having to try. You can create and import your own flashcard decks for any subject.</p><p>The only/biggest caveat about flashysurf is that you need to use it for a bit of time to see results like I used it for 2 months to see that 100 point increase (technically that was an outdated version with far less optimizations, so it should take less time) so you can&#39;t just use it for a test you have tmrw (unless you set it to be like 100% which would mean that a flashcard would appear on every single website).</p><p>It has a few more features that I couldn&#39;t mention here: AI flashcard generation from documents; 30 minute breaks to focus; stats on flashcard collections; and for the SAT, performance reports. (Also if ur wondering why i&#39;m using semicolons, I actually learnt that from studying the SAT using flashysurf lol)</p><p>And for you guys in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/python">r/python</a>, I thought this would be perfect for drilling concepts that just need repetition. So, if you go to the flashysurf <a href="https://flashysurf.com/creator">flashcard creator</a> you can actually use the AI flashcard import/maker tool to convert any documents (i.e. programming problems/exercises you have) or your own flashcard decks into flashysurf flashcards. So you can work on complex programming topics like Big O notation, dynamic programming, and graph theory algorithms. Note: You will obviously need the extension to use the cards lol but when you install the extension, you&#39;ll recieve <a href="https://flashysurf.com/onboarding">instructions</a> on creating and importing flashcards, so you don&#39;t gotta memorize any of this.</p><p>You can download it from the Chrome Web Store, link in the website: <a href="https://flashysurf.com/?utm_source=rpst&amp;utm_campaign=rpython">https://flashysurf.com/</a></p><p>I&#39;m still actively working on it (just pushed a bugfix yesterday lol), so I&#39;d love to hear any feedback or ideas you have. Hope it helps you learn something new while you&#39;re procrastinating on your actual work.</p><p>Thanks for reading :D</p><p>Complicance thingy</p><h1>What My Project Does</h1><p>FlashySurf is a free, open-source Chrome extension that helps users learn and study by showing them flashcards as they browse the web. It uses a spaced repetition algorithm with semantic analysis to identify and target a user&#39;s weaknesses. The extension also has features like a &quot;Forced Note-Taking&quot; system to ensure users learn from their mistakes, and it allows for custom flashcard decks so it can be used for any subject.</p><h1>Target Audience</h1><p>FlashySurf is intended for anyone who wants to learn or study new information without the effort of a formal study session. It is particularly useful for students, professionals, or hobbyists who spend a lot of time on the web and want to use that time more productively. It&#39;s a production-ready project that&#39;s been in development for over six months, with a focus on being a long-term learning tool.</p><h1>Comparison</h1><p>While there are other flashcard and spaced repetition tools, FlashySurf stands out by integrating learning directly into a user&#39;s everyday browsing habits. Unlike traditional apps like Anki, which require dedicated study sessions, FlashySurf brings the flashcards to you. Its unique combination of a spaced repetition algorithm with a semantic clustering system means it not only reinforces what you&#39;ve learned but actively focuses on related topics where you are weakest. This approach is designed to help &quot;lazy&quot; learners like me who struggle with traditional study methods.</p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section>]]></description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 03:10:42 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1ngy2ha/another_free_python_3_book_files_and_directories/</link><title>Another free Python 3 book - Files and Directories</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1ngy2ha/another_free_python_3_book_files_and_directories/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1ngy2ha/another_free_python_3_book_files_and_directories/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p>Reading time: 1 min | <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1ngy2ha/another_free_python_3_book_files_and_directories/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='separator separator-after-permalink'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='selftext'><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>If you are interested, you can click the top link on my landing page and download my eBook, &quot;Working with Files and Directories in Python 3&quot; for free: <a href="https://tr.ee/MFl4Mmyu1B">https://tr.ee/MFl4Mmyu1B</a></p><p>I recently gave away a Beginner&#39;s Python Book and that went really well</p><p>So I hope this 26 page pdf will be useful for someone interested in working with Files and Directories  in Python.

The program allows single MIDI files or playlists of MIDI files to be loaded and visualised through a command-line tool.</p><p>It&#39;s fairly simple, using Pygame to display the visualiser window and provide playback control, but I&#39;m pretty proud of how it looks and the audio-syncing logic (which uses Mido to interpret MIDI events). More details on how to use it are available in the <a href="https://github.com/benjaminrall/midi-visualiser">project repository</a>.</p><p>This is the first project I&#39;ve used <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/">uv</a> for, and I absolutely love it - check it out if you haven&#39;t already. Also, any suggestions/comments about the project would be greatly appreciated as I&#39;m very new to uploading to PyPI!</p><p>To summarise;- <strong>What My Project Does</strong>: Plays MIDI files and visualises them using a scrolling piano roll- <strong>Target Audience</strong>: Mainly just a toy project, but could be used by anyone who wants a simple &amp; quick way to view any MIDI file!- <strong>Comparison</strong>: I can&#39;t find any alternatives that have this same functionality (at least not made in Python) - it obviously can&#39;t compete with mega fancy MIDI visualisers, but a strong point is how straight forward the project is, working immediately from the command-line without needing any configuration.</p><p>Edit: Thanks to a comment, I&#39;ve discovered an issue that means this only works on Windows - will look into fixing this, sorry!</p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section>]]></description><pubDate>Sun, 14 Sep 2025 03:04:14 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1ng2h8x/splittermr_a_modular_library_for_splitting/</link><title>SplitterMR: a modular library for splitting &amp;amp; parsing documents</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1ng2h8x/splittermr_a_modular_library_for_splitting/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1ng2h8x/splittermr_a_modular_library_for_splitting/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p>Reading time: 2 min | <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1ng2h8x/splittermr_a_modular_library_for_splitting/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='separator separator-after-permalink'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='selftext'><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey guys, I just released <strong>SplitterMR</strong>, a library I built because none of the existing tools quite did what I wanted for slicing up documents cleanly for LLMs / downstream processing.</p><p>If you often work with <strong>mixed document types</strong> (PDFs, Word, Excel, Markdown, images, etc.) and <strong>need flexible, reliable splitting/parsing</strong>, this might be useful.</p><p>This library supports <strong>multiple input formats</strong>, e.g., text, Markdown, PDF, Word / Excel / PowerPoint, HTML / XML, JSON / YAML, CSV / TSV, and even images.</p><p>Files can be read using <strong>MarkItDown</strong> or <strong>Docling</strong>, so this is perfect if you are using those frameworks with your current applications.</p><p>Logically, it supports <strong>many different splitting strategies</strong>: not only based on the number of characters but on tokens, schema keys, semantic similarity, and many other techniques.

I wanted something lightweight, easy to use (exploratory), and something that would support numerical methods more easily. Hence, I created this lightweight wrapper that provides a hybrid symbolic-numerical interface to symbolic and numerical backends. It is backward compatible with Sympy. In short, this enables much faster analysis of symbolic math expressions by providing both numerical and traditional symbolic methods of analysis in the same interface. I have also added additional numerical methods that neither SymPy nor SciPy have (Pade approximations, numerical roots, etc.). The main goal for this project is to provide a tool that requires as little of a learning curve as possible and allows them to just focus on the math they are doing.</p><h1>Core features</h1><ul><li><strong>🔒 Operative Closure</strong>: Mathematical operations return new Expression objects by default</li><li><strong>⚡ Mutability Control</strong>: Choose between immutable (default) and mutable expressions for different workflows</li><li><strong>🔗 Seamless Numerical Integration</strong>: Every symbolic expression has a <code>.n</code> attribute providing numerical methods without manual lambdification (uses cached lambdified expression when needed)</li><li><strong>🎨 Enhanced Printing</strong>: Flexible output formatting through the <code>.print</code> attribute (LaTeX, pretty printing, code generation)</li><li><strong>📡 Signal System</strong>: Qt-like signals for tracking expression mutations and clones, enabling reactive programming</li><li><strong>🔄 Automatic Type Conversions</strong>: Seamlessly and automatically converts between internal Poly and Expr representations based on context</li><li><strong>📦 Lightweight</strong>: ~0.5 MB itself, ~100 MB including dependencies</li><li><strong>🧩 Fully backward compatible</strong>: Seamlessly integrate SymPy and MathFlow in the same script. All methods that work on SymPy Expr or Poly objects work on MathFlow objects</li><li><strong>🔍 Exploratory</strong>: Full IDE support, enabling easy tool finding and minimizing the learning curve.</li></ul><p>A few examples are shown below.

You can build pipelines visually and export to Python, or write Python and visualize it. The Custom Node Designer lets you define new visual nodes using Python classes with Pydantic for settings and Polars for data processing.</p><h1>Target Audience</h1><p>Production-ready tool for data engineers who work with ETL pipelines. Also useful for prototyping and teams that need both visual and code representations of their workflows.</p><h1>Comparison</h1><ul><li><strong>Alteryx</strong>: Proprietary, expensive. Flowfile is open-source.</li><li><strong>Apache NiFi</strong>: Java-based, requires infrastructure. Flowfile is pip-installable Python.</li><li><strong>Prefect/Dagster</strong>: Orchestration-focused. Flowfile focuses on visual pipeline building.</li></ul><h1>Custom Node Example</h1><pre><code>import polars as plfrom flowfile_core.flowfile.node_designer import (    CustomNodeBase, NodeSettings, Section,    ColumnSelector, MultiSelect, Types)class TextCleanerSettings(NodeSettings):    cleaning_options: Section = Section(        title=&quot;Cleaning Options&quot;,        text_column=ColumnSelector(label=&quot;Column to Clean&quot;, data_types=Types.String),        operations=MultiSelect(            label=&quot;Cleaning Operations&quot;,            options=[&quot;lowercase&quot;, &quot;remove_punctuation&quot;, &quot;trim&quot;],            default=[&quot;lowercase&quot;, &quot;trim&quot;]        )    )class TextCleanerNode(CustomNodeBase):    node_name: str = &quot;Text Cleaner&quot;    settings_schema: TextCleanerSettings = TextCleanerSettings()    def process(self, input_df: pl.LazyFrame) -&gt; pl.LazyFrame:        text_col = self.settings_schema.cleaning_options.text_column.value        operations = self.settings_schema.cleaning_options.operations.value        expr = pl.col(text_col)        if &quot;lowercase&quot; in operations:            expr = expr.str.to_lowercase()        if &quot;trim&quot; in operations:            expr = expr.str.strip_chars()        return input_df.with_columns(expr.alias(f&quot;{text_col}_cleaned&quot;))</code></pre><p>Save in <code>~/.flowfile/user_defined_nodes/</code> and it appears in the visual editor.</p><h1>Why This Matters</h1><p>You can wrap complex tasks—API connections, custom validations, niche library functions—into simple drag-and-drop blocks.

As an experiment, I got curious to see if I could build a lightweight HTML/CSS to image converter on top of it, without the overhead of a full browser engine like Selenium or Playwright.</p><p><strong>Important</strong>: this is a proof-of-concept, and a large portion of the code was generated with AI assistance (primarily Claude) to quickly explore the idea. It&#39;s definitely not production-ready and likely has plenty of bugs and unhandled edge cases.</p><p>I&#39;m sharing it here to show what I&#39;ve been exploring, maybe it could be useful for someone.</p><p>Here&#39;s the link to the repo: <a href="https://github.com/francozanardi/html2pic">https://github.com/francozanardi/html2pic</a></p><hr/><h3>What My Project Does</h3><p><code>html2pic</code> takes a subset of HTML and CSS and renders it into a PNG, JPG, or SVG image, using Python + Skia. It also uses BeautifulSoup4 for HTML parsing, tinycss2 for CSS parsing.</p><p>Here’s a basic example:</p><p>```pythonfrom html2pic import Html2Pic</p><p>html = &#39;&#39;&#39;&lt;div class=&quot;card&quot;&gt;  &lt;div class=&quot;avatar&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class=&quot;user-info&quot;&gt;    &lt;h2&gt;pictex_dev&lt;/h2&gt;    &lt;p&gt;@python_renderer&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&#39;&#39;&#39;</p><p>css = &#39;&#39;&#39;.card {    font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;    display: flex;    align-items: center;    gap: 16px;    padding: 20px;    background-color: #1a1b21;    border-radius: 12px;    width: 350px;    box-shadow: 0px 4px 12px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4);}</p><p>.avatar {    width: 60px;    height: 60px;    border-radius: 50%;    background-image: linear-gradient(45deg, #f97794, #623aa2);}</p><p>.user-info {    display: flex;    flex-direction: column;}</p><p>h2 {    margin: 0;    font-size: 22px;    font-weight: 600;    color: #e6edf3;}</p><p>p {    margin: 0;    font-size: 16px;    color: #7d8590;}&#39;&#39;&#39;</p><p>renderer = Html2Pic(html, css)image = renderer.render()image.save(&quot;profile_card.png&quot;)```</p><p>And here&#39;s the image it generates:</p><p><strong><a href="https://i.imgur.com/UKGA0lH.png">Quick Start Result Image</a></strong></p><hr/><h3>Target Audience</h3><p>Right now, this is a <strong>toy project / proof-of-concept</strong>.</p><p>It&#39;s intended for hobbyists, developers who want to prototype image generation, or for simple, controlled use cases where installing a full browser feels like overkill. For example:*   Generating simple social media cards with dynamic text.*   Creating basic components for reports.*   Quickly visualizing HTML/CSS snippets without opening a browser.</p><p>It is <strong>not</strong> meant for production environments or for rendering complex HTML/CSS. It is absolutely not a browser replacement.</p><hr/><h3>Comparison</h3><ul><li>  <strong>vs. Selenium / Playwright:</strong> The main difference is the lack of a browser. <code>html2pic</code> is much more lightweight and has fewer dependencies. The trade-off is that it only supports a tiny fraction of HTML/CSS.</li></ul><hr/><p>Thanks for checking it out.</p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section>]]></description><pubDate>Fri, 12 Sep 2025 11:02:04 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1ner9mj/best_way_to_install_python_package_with_all_its/</link><title>Best way to install python package with all its dependencies on an offline pc. -- Part 2</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1ner9mj/best_way_to_install_python_package_with_all_its/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1ner9mj/best_way_to_install_python_package_with_all_its/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p>Reading time: 2 min | <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1ner9mj/best_way_to_install_python_package_with_all_its/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='separator separator-after-permalink'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='selftext'><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This is a follow up post to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1keaeft/best_way_to_install_python_package_with_all_its/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1keaeft/best_way_to_install_python_package_with_all_its/</a><br/>I followed one of the techniques shown in that post and it worked quite well.<br/>So in short what i do is<br/>first do<br/><code>python -m venv .</code> ( in a  directory)<br/>then <code>.\Scripts\activate</code><br/>then do the actual installation of the package with <code>pip install &lt;packagename&gt;</code><br/>then i do a <code>pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt</code><br/>and finally i download the wheels using this requirements.txt.<br/>For that i create a folder called wheel and then I do a <code>pip download -r requirements.txt</code><br/>then i copy over the wheels folder to the offline pc and create a venv over there and do the install using that wheel folder.</p><p>So all this works quite well as long as there as only wheel files in the package.<br/>Lately I see that there are packages that need some dependencies that need to be built from source so instead of the <code>whl</code> file a <code>tar.gz</code> file gets downloaded in the wheel folder.

It came out of me needing a clean way to distribute Python wheels <em>with</em> all of their dependencies and optional extras, but <em>without</em> having to freeze them into platform-specific binaries like PyInstaller does. And if you want to just install everything into your own current environment?  That&#39;s what I wanted, too.</p><h1>So what is it?</h1><p><strong>pychub</strong> takes your wheel, resolves and downloads its dependencies, and wraps everything into a single executable <code>.chub</code> file. That file can then be shipped/copied anywhere, and then run directly like this:</p><pre><code>python yourtool.chub</code></pre><p>It installs into the current environment (or a venv, or a conda env, your call), and can even run an entrypoint function or console script <em>right after</em> install.</p><p>No network calls. No pip. No virtualenv setup. Just <code>python tool.chub</code> and go.</p><h1>Why I built it:</h1><p>Most of the Python packaging tools out there either:</p><ul><li>Freeze the whole thing into a binary (PyInstaller, PyOxidizer) — which is great, until you hit platform issues or need to debug something. Or you just want to do something different than that.</li><li>Just stop at building a wheel and leave it up to you (or your users) to figure out installation, dependencies, and environment prep.</li></ul><p>I wanted something in between: still using the host Python interpreter (so it stays light and portable), but with everything pre-downloaded and reproducible.</p><h1>What it can bundle:</h1><ul><li>Your main wheel</li><li>Any number of additional wheels</li><li>All their dependencies (downloaded and stored locally)</li><li>Optional include files (configs, docs, whatever)</li><li>Pre-install and post-install scripts (shell, Python, etc.)</li></ul><p>And it’s 100% reproducible, so that the archive installs the exact same versions every time, no network access needed.</p><h1>Build tool integration:</h1><p>If you&#39;re using <strong>Poetry</strong>, <strong>Hatch</strong>, or <strong>PDM</strong>, I’ve released plugins for all three:</p><ul><li>Just add the plugin to your <code>pyproject.toml</code></li><li>Specify your build details (main wheel, includes, scripts, etc.)</li><li>Run your normal build command and you’ll get a <code>.chub</code> alongside your <code>.whl</code></li></ul><p>It’s one of the easiest ways to ship Python tools that <em>just work,</em> whether you&#39;re distributing internally, packaging for air-gapped environments, or dropping into Docker builder stages.</p><p>Plugins repo:  <a href="https://github.com/Steve973/pychub-build-plugins">https://github.com/Steve973/pychub-build-plugins</a></p><h1>Why not just use some other bundling/packaging tool?</h1><p>Well, depending on your needs, maybe you should! I don’t think pychub replaces everything. It just solves a different problem.</p><p>If you want sealed apps with bundled runtimes, use PEX or PyOxidizer.<br/>If you&#39;re distributing scripts, zipapp is great.<br/>But if you want a <strong>wheel-based</strong>, network-free, single-file installer that works on any Python 3.9+ environment, then pychub might be the right tool.</p><p>Full comparison table along with everything else:<br/>📘 <a href="https://github.com/Steve973/pychub#why-not-just-use-insert-favorite-tool-name-here">README on GitHub</a></p><p>That’s it.

The compiled codes will be standalone local computational tools without any frills (no guis, no i|o or r|w operations, no system access, and no backend or configuration needs to pull in). Python code is &gt;=3.8 and can pull in external libraries (eg: numpy). However, the codes may be multithreaded/multiprocessed and any static type-like behavior is not guaranteed.</p><p>Historically I have used tools like pyinstaller, py2exe, py2app, which work robustly, but create stand alone executable files that are often pretty slow. I have been looking at a host of transpilers instead, eg: <a href="https://github.com/dbohdan/compilers-targeting-c?tab=readme-ov-file">https://github.com/dbohdan/compilers-targeting-c?tab=readme-ov-file</a>, and am somewhat overwhelmed by the amount of choices therein. Going through stackoverflow naturally recovered a lot of great recommendations that were go-to&#39;s 10-20 years ago, but do not have much promise for recent python versions. Currently I am considering:<br/>wax <a href="https://github.com/LingDong-/wax">https://github.com/LingDong-/wax</a> ,<br/>11l-lang <a href="https://11l-lang.org/transpiler/">https://11l-lang.org/transpiler/</a>,<br/>nuitka <a href="https://nuitka.net/">https://nuitka.net/</a>,<br/>prometeo  <a href="https://github.com/zanellia/prometeo">https://github.com/zanellia/prometeo</a>,<br/>pytran <a href="https://pythran.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">https://pythran.readthedocs.io/en/latest/</a>,<br/>rpython <a href="https://rpython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">https://rpython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/</a>,<br/>or py14  <a href="https://github.com/lukasmartinelli/py14">https://github.com/lukasmartinelli/py14</a>.<br/>However, this is a lot to consider without rigorously testing all of them out. Does anyone on this sub have experience in modern Transpilers or other techniques for compiling numerical python codes for linux? If so, can you share any tools, techniques, or general guidance? Thank you!</p><p>Edit for clarification:<br/>This will be placed in a user facing application wherein users can upload their tools to be autonomously deployed in a on demand/dynamic runtime basis. Since we cannot know all the codes that users are uploading, a lot of the traditional and well defined methods are not possible. We are including C, C++, Rust, Fortran, Go, and Cobol compilers to support these languages, but seeking a similar solution for python.</p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section>]]></description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Sep 2025 04:43:04 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1ncmlwv/should_i_give_away_my_app_to_my_employer_for_free/</link><title>Should I give away my app to my employer for free?</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1ncmlwv/should_i_give_away_my_app_to_my_employer_for_free/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1ncmlwv/should_i_give_away_my_app_to_my_employer_for_free/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p>Reading time: 2 min | <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1ncmlwv/should_i_give_away_my_app_to_my_employer_for_free/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='separator separator-after-permalink'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='selftext'><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I work for a fintech company in the UK (in operations to be specific) however my daily role doesn’t require any coding knowledge.

Instead of just reading about them, I decided to build my own FP language from scratch. It started as a tiny DSL (domain specific language) for a specific problem (which it turned out to be terrible for!), but I enjoyed the core ideas enough to expand it into a full functional language.</p><h2>What My Project Does</h2><p>NumFu is a pure functional programming language interpreted in Python featuring:- <strong>Arbitrary precision arithmetic</strong> using <code>mpmath</code> - no floating point issues- <strong>Automatic partial application</strong> and function composition - <strong>Built-in testing syntax</strong> with readable assertions- <strong>Tail call optimization</strong> for efficient recursion- <strong>Clean syntax</strong> with only four types (Number, Boolean, List, String)</p><p>Here&#39;s a taste of the syntax:</p><p>```numfu// Functions automatically partially apply</p><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>{a, b, c -&gt; a + b + c}(_, 5){a, c -&gt; a+5+c}  // Even prints as readable syntax!</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><p>// Composition and pipeslet add1 = {x -&gt; x + 1},    double = {x -&gt; x * 2}in 5 |&gt; (add1 &gt;&gt; double) // 12</p><p>// Built-in testinglet square = {x -&gt; x * x} insquare(7) ---&gt; $ == 49  // ✓ passes```</p><h2>Target Audience</h2><p>This is <strong>not</strong> a production language - it&#39;s 2-5x slower than Python due to double interpretation. It&#39;s more of a learning tool for:- Teaching functional programming concepts without complex syntax- Sketching mathematical algorithms where precision matters more than speed- Understanding how interpreters work</p><h2>Comparison</h2><p>NumFu has much simpler syntax than traditional functional languages like Haskell or ML and no complex type system - just four basic types. It&#39;s less powerful but much more approachable. I designed it to make FP concepts accessible without getting bogged down in advanced language features. Think of it as functional programming with training wheels.</p><h2>Implementation Details</h2><p>The implementation is about 3,500 lines of Python using:- <em>Lark</em> for parsing- <em>Tree-walking interpreter</em> - straightforward recursive evaluation<br/>- <em>mpmath</em> for arbitrary precision arithmetic</p><h2>Try It Out</h2><p><code>bashpip install numfu-langnumfu repl</code></p><h2>Links</h2><p>I actually enjoy web design, so NumFu has a (probably overly fancy) landing page + documentation site. 😅</p><ul><li>GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/rphle/numfu">https://github.com/rphle/numfu</a><br/></li><li>Website: <a href="https://rphle.github.io/numfu/">https://rphle.github.io/numfu/</a></li><li>Documentation: <a href="https://rphle.github.io/numfu/docs">https://rphle.github.io/numfu/docs</a></li><li>PyPI: <a href="https://pypi.org/project/numfu-lang/">https://pypi.org/project/numfu-lang/</a></li></ul><p>I built this as a learning exercise and it&#39;s been fun to work on.

I also really appreciate issues and pull requests!</p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section>]]></description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Sep 2025 16:20:58 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1nb8x34/monday_daily_thread_project_ideas/</link><title>Monday Daily Thread: Project ideas!</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1nb8x34/monday_daily_thread_project_ideas/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1nb8x34/monday_daily_thread_project_ideas/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p>Reading time: 2 min | <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1nb8x34/monday_daily_thread_project_ideas/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='separator separator-after-permalink'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='selftext'><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><h1>Weekly Thread: Project Ideas 💡</h1><p>Welcome to our weekly Project Ideas thread!
