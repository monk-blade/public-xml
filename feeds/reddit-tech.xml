The response from Republican commentators has been <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/politics-news/maga-reaction-jimmy-kimmel-suspension-1236374491/">predictably gleeful</a>. They&rsquo;ve positioned the suspension as a reversal of &ldquo;cancel culture,&rdquo; a &ldquo;deplatforming&rdquo; that&rsquo;s simply fair retaliation for antagonizing them. &ldquo;Jimmy Kimmel does have Free Speech, he is free to speak just not on ABC,&rdquo; posted comedian <a href="https://x.com/w_terrence/status/1968521190693019710">Terrence Kentrell Williams on X</a>.</p><p>This framing is transparently false. ABC&rsquo;s suspension of Kimmel was the result of an explicit threat from President Donald Trump&rsquo;s Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr, aimed at Disney and companies that worked with it. The move was effective because of the FCC&rsquo;s authority to regulate broadcast TV and, perhaps more importantly, to approve communications mergers in a hyper-consolidated landscape. It was repeating a playbook Carr recently used on Disney&rsquo;s fellow media giant Paramount. And it&rsquo;s an unabashed attempt at the government dictating the speech of private TV networks and entertainers, as objectionable and un-American as a McCarthyist blacklist.</p><p>The starting point of all this is a pretty tame late-night show monologue. On Monday, Kimmel said the following:</p><p>&ldquo;We hit some new lows over the weekend, with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it.&rdquo;</p><p>The line led into a clip from last week in which Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/16/arts/television/late-night-trump-white-house-ballroom.html">responded to Kirk&rsquo;s death</a> by bragging about the new White House ballroom &mdash; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s at the fourth stage of grief: construction,&rdquo; Kimmel quipped.</p><p>Carr and other Republicans loudly interpreted the remark as claiming Tyler Robinson, who&rsquo;s charged with killing Kirk, was part of MAGA. (An <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/09/16/us/tyler-robinson-charges.html">indictment released</a> Tuesday says Robinson believed Kirk was spreading &ldquo;hate&rdquo;; at the time of Kimmel&rsquo;s monologue, the evidence was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/politics/777313/charlie-kirks-alleged-killer-scratched-bullets-with-a-helldivers-combo-and-a-furry-sex-meme">mostly confusing</a> and speculation was rife.)</p><p>On Wednesday, Carr <a href="https://x.com/bennyjohnson/status/1968359685045838041">appeared in high dudgeon</a> for an interview with conservative commentator Benny Johnson. &ldquo;It appears to be some of the sickest conduct possible,&rdquo; Carr intoned over a clip of Kimmel&rsquo;s statement. It was also, he said, legally actionable. Broadcasters &ldquo;have a license granted by us at the FCC, and that comes with an obligation to operate in the public interest,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We can do this the easy way or the hard way. These companies can find ways to change conduct and take action, frankly, on Kimmel, or there&rsquo;s going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.&rdquo;</p><p>Carr and Johnson walked out the threat a little further. They noted that Disney and ABC aren&rsquo;t issued a central license to broadcast; licenses are granted to individual TV stations, owned in small numbers by Disney but mainly by separate companies that broadcast ABC and other networks&rsquo; programming. &ldquo;FCC regulatory action focuses on these individual stations,&rdquo; Carr noted. &ldquo;The public interest means you can&rsquo;t be running a narrow partisan circus and still meeting your public interest obligations.&rdquo;</p><p>Citing rules against &ldquo;news distortion&rdquo; and &ldquo;broadcast hoaxes,&rdquo; Carr repeated that &ldquo;there&rsquo;s actions we can take on licensed broadcasters. And frankly, I think it&rsquo;s really past time that a lot of these licensed broadcasters themselves push back on Comcast and Disney and say, &lsquo;Listen, we are going to preempt, we are not going to run Kimmel anymore until you straighten this out, because we, a licensed broadcaster, are running the possibility of fines or license revocation from the FCC if we continue to run content that ends up being a pattern of news distortion.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>This is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24283652/fcc-license-donald-trump-elon-musk-first-amendment-fairness-doctrine-please-vote-decoder">not how any pre-Carr FCC in recent memory</a> (or arguably before that) has defined the &ldquo;public interest&rdquo; requirement. If the issue is a &ldquo;narrow partisan circus,&rdquo; the highly partisan Fox &mdash; whose news division <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/18/23688582/fox-dominion-election-defamation-lawsuit-settled-trial-averted">settled a massive defamation suit</a> for lying about voting machine companies in 2023 &mdash; has been a stolid fixture on TV stations across the country for decades. Carr invoked rules against &ldquo;news distortion&rdquo; and &ldquo;broadcast hoaxes,&rdquo; neither of which makes logical sense as a charge against Kimmel. The bar for stripping a license is typically high &mdash; a rare example is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1979/12/07/archives/black-group-is-awarded-license-for-television-station-in.html">the 1989 revocation</a> of aggressively pro-segregationist station WLBT, which among other things, blacked out broadcasts involving civil rights.</p><p>Some commentators on the left <em>have </em>pushed for the FCC to do what Carr threatened, just with Fox instead of ABC, particularly <a href="https://prospect.org/blogs-and-newsletters/tap/2023-08-28-will-fox-lose-its-broadcast-license/">after the defamation settlement</a>. But the FCC has never pulled a station&rsquo;s license as a result of this urging, and <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/09/brendan-carr-jimmy-kimmel-public-interest-1236547721/">in 2019 Carr decried</a> even Democratic commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel&rsquo;s suggestion they crack down on TV and radio e-cigarette ads, saying the FCC &ldquo;does not have a roving mandate to police speech in the name of the &lsquo;public interest.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>Carr&rsquo;s statement on Wednesday was unambiguous: ABC-affiliated TV stations needed to stop airing Kimmel&rsquo;s show ASAP, or they could be fined or lose their license. And the stations&rsquo; parent companies were listening. Nexstar, which owns around 200 stations and reaches roughly 39 percent of US households, <a href="https://www.nexstar.tv/nexstar-abc-affiliates-to-preempt-jimmy-kimmel-live-indefinitely-beginning-tonight/">said quickly</a> that it would no longer air <em>Jimmy Kimmel Live</em>. So did <a href="https://sbgi.net/sinclair-says-kimmel-suspension-is-not-enough-calls-on-fcc-and-abc-to-take-additional-action/">fellow giant Sinclair Broadcast Group</a>.</p><p>Those companies, particularly Nexstar, have reasons beyond station licensing to keep Carr happy. Nexstar is pushing for a $6.2 billion merger with broadcaster Tegna that would require the FCC to loosen the rules on TV station consolidation, something CEO Perry Sook <a href="https://www.newscaststudio.com/2025/08/22/nexstar-ceo-perry-sook-defends-6-2b-tegna-acquisition-as-regulatory-shift-creates-opening/">has expressed hope</a> that Trump&rsquo;s &ldquo;deregulatory moment&rdquo; will enable.</p><p>Carr has shown himself willing to slow-walk deals with companies that earn his ire. A merger between Paramount and Skydance was not approved until Paramount subsidiary CBS <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/696422/paramount-settlement-trump-cbs-lawsuit">agreed to pay $16 million</a> to resolve a blatantly frivolous lawsuit filed by Trump. It proceeded on the grounds that Skydance promote a &ldquo;diversity of viewpoints from across the political and ideological spectrum&rdquo; and employ an ombudsman who would &ldquo;receive and evaluate any complaints of bias or other concerns involving CBS.&rdquo; CBS also ended the show of Kimmel&rsquo;s fellow late-night host Stephen Colbert, a decision <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/709544/stephen-colberts-version-of-the-late-show-will-end-next-may">CBS called financial</a> that was nonetheless widely seen as a concession to Trump &mdash; and that was celebrated by Carr.</p><p>The pressure from Carr, Sinclair, and Nexstar quickly reached ABC, which made a terse announcement it had pulled Kimmel&rsquo;s show off the air. Outlets with inside sources have indicated this wasn&rsquo;t because of public outrage or because Kimmel&rsquo;s bosses found the remarks inappropriate &mdash; <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-news/jimmy-kimmel-out-abc-charlie-kirk-comments-1235430078/"><em>Rolling Stone</em> reports</a> that &ldquo;multiple execs felt that Kimmel had not actually said anything over the line.&rdquo; Instead, they were &ldquo;pissing themselves&rdquo; over the threat of Trump administration retaliation, one source said.</p><p>Disney, too, has pressure points beyond broadcast license fines. The FCC chair has previously threatened to investigate it for having (non-&ldquo;ideological,&rdquo; of course) diversity programs. And as <a href="https://www.status.news/p/jimmy-kimmel-pulled-fcc-decision">Oliver Darcy of <em>Status</em> notes</a>, the company is &ldquo;working to complete a high-stakes deal with the NFL, one that is crucial to the future of ESPN&rdquo; and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/espn-nfl-deal-faces-regulatory-hurdles-2025-08-07/">requires regulatory approval</a> from the Department of Justice. Trump <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/attorney-general-pam-bondi-doj-hate-speech-rcna231633">incidentally told</a> an ABC journalist this week that the DOJ might &ldquo;come after ABC&rdquo; for &ldquo;hate&rdquo; offenses, responding to questions about a &ldquo;hate speech&rdquo; crackdown declared by Attorney General Pam Bondi after Kirk&rsquo;s death.</p><p>Under the First Amendment, a government official like Carr is allowed to call Kimmel talentless or unfunny. He&rsquo;s allowed to say Kimmel shouldn&rsquo;t be on the air. He&rsquo;s <em>not </em>allowed to accompany this with a clear threat backed by government authority. &ldquo;The easy way or the hard way&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t healthy debate, it&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/20/24346317/trump-gangster-tech-regulation-corruption-grift">gangster talk</a>. Or more precisely, government jawboning.</p><p>Even the substantially Trump-picked, overwhelmingly conservative Supreme Court has condemned something very similar to Carr&rsquo;s conduct. <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2025/09/17/cowardly-disney-caves-to-brendan-carrs-bogus-censorial-threats-pulling-jimmy-kimmel/">Mike Masnick at <em>Techdirt</em> points out</a> that a ruling last year, in the case <em>NRA v. Vullo</em>, declared flatly that &ldquo;the First Amendment prohibits government officials from relying on the &lsquo;threat of invoking legal sanctions and other means of coercion . . . to achieve the suppression&rsquo; of disfavored speech.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s true even if they do so through intermediaries like Nexstar rather than attacking the speaker directly.</p><p>Disney, of course, didn&rsquo;t have to bow to a clearly unconstitutional threat. CEO Bob Iger and Disney Entertainment chief Dana Walden, according to <em>Status</em>, were among the latest powerful figures who made a cowardly decision to appease Carr and Trump rather than stand up for themselves and their employees in public and, if necessary, in court.</p><p>But even if there&rsquo;s plenty of blame to go around, Carr&rsquo;s threat is impossible to ignore &mdash; and the implicit comparisons to conservative provocateurs being banned on social media, or commentators being fired after outcry for a hateful statement, or any other example of alleged &ldquo;cancel culture,&rdquo; off-base. Whatever the underlying offense, this isn&rsquo;t a private company independently making a business judgment about its public image and financial interests. It&rsquo;s a government official inserting himself into the process of making entertainment, decreeing what a comedian is allowed to say.</p><p>Carr and Johnson aren&rsquo;t denying the pressure campaign. Carr responded to a request for comment from <em>Status</em> with a grinning emoji and <a href="https://x.com/BrendanCarrFCC/status/1968449919221416427">thanked Nexstar on X</a> for &ldquo;doing the right thing.&rdquo; Johnson <a href="https://x.com/bennyjohnson/status/1968464339515417001">crowed on X</a> that he had &ldquo;ended Jimmy Kimmel&rsquo;s career&rdquo; by bringing Carr on to &ldquo;announce investigations into ABC and Disney.&rdquo;<br>It&rsquo;s unclear whether Kimmel will come back on the air at some point &mdash; but either way, the Trump administration&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/779799/republican-charlie-kirk-first-amendment-crackdown-continues">war on free speech</a> is still going strong.</p><p><em><strong>Correction:</strong> The proposed merger between Nexstar and Tegna is worth $6.2 billion, not million.</em></p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/781148/jimmy-kimmel-charlie-kirk-monologue-brendan-carr-censorship-first-amendment#comments"><span>0 Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li><span><span><span>Adi Robertson</span></span></span></li><li><li><li><li><li></ul></div></div></section><section class='separator separator-before-comments'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='comments'><p>Top comments</p><ol><li><div class="md"><p>Jimmy Kimmel doesn&#39;t need to be a part of the conversation.

Perhaps smart glasses should be added to that list, if yesterday's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D97ILdUbYww">Meta Connect 2025 livestream</a> is anything to go by&mdash;as the new <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7706533-17145766?sid=pcg-gb-1331860904822642313&amp;url=https://www.ray-ban.com/usa/discover-ray-ban-meta-ai-glasses/clp">Ray-Ban Meta glasses</a> took the opportunity to misbehave at almost every turn.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/D97ILdUbYww?feature=shared&amp;t=2084">Unveiled to great fanfare</a> and a rapt audience by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, the second-generation smart glasses were promised to be capable of "empowering people with new abilities" and said to allow users to "make themselves smarter" thanks to the newly-polished AI functionality. Cool stuff, but when it came to the demos, things didn't exactly go to plan.</p><p>Switching over to a livestreamed demonstration, displayed to the audience on a gigantic panel at Zuckerberg's side,<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@CHEFCUSO"> chef Jack Mancuso</a> attempted to use the Live AI functionality of the smart specs to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/D97ILdUbYww?feature=shared&amp;t=2427">help them make a Korean-inspired steak sauce</a>. Standing in front of multiple unprepared ingredients (which the glasses initially appeared to recognise) the Meta specs immediately ignored a prompt to help make the sauce, instead listing the ingredients that might go in it.</p><p>Interrupting, Mancuso asked the AI a reasonable question: "What do I do first?" After a long silence, in which metaphorical pins could be heard dropping in the audience, Mancuso asked again. The AI then merrily informed our now visibly-nervous host that the base of the sauce was already made.</p><p>Another long pause. "What do I do first?" Mancuso asked once more, to laughter from the audience. "You've already combined the base ingredients," the AI continued, helpfully telling Mancuso to grate a pear into the non-existent sauce. "Alright, I think the Wi-Fi might be messed up" said Mancuso, looking embarrassed. "Back to you Mark."</p><figure><figcaption><span>(Image credit: Meta Developers)</span></figcaption></figure><p>"It's all good, it's all good" said Zuckerberg, amid cheers, laughter, and applause from the crowd. "The irony of all this whole thing is that you spend years making technology and then the Wi-Fi on the day kinda... catches you. We'll go check out what he made later."</p><p>Still, more demos were yet to come. Later in the presentation, Zuckerberg donned a pair of Ray-Ban Meta glasses himself, along with a wristband interface said to be able to control the glasses through muscle movements.</p><div><section><p>Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.</p></section></div><p>"Now, I want to get into this in more detail, we've got two options," said Zuckerberg, laughing nervously. "We've got the slides, or we've got the live demo." At this point, the audience erupted into shouts for the live version, unsurprisingly, along with more laughter.</p><p>Guess how it went. Zuckerberg was able to respond to a video call request with text via hand movements, which is fairly impressive, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/D97ILdUbYww?feature=shared&amp;t=3228">but was unable to answer the call itself</a>.</p><figure><figcaption><span>(Image credit: Meta Developers)</span></figcaption></figure><p>"Uh-oh," said the Meta CEO, frantically rubbing his fingers together in an attempt to pick up the line. "Well, I&hellip; let's see what happened there. That's too bad. I don't know what happened. Maybe Boz can try calling me again."</p><p>Nope. Despite multiple attempts, Zuckerberg was left standing on stage twiddling his fingers, as the Meta AI voice digitally crunched to tell him yet another call was incoming that he seemed unable to answer. At one point, Zuckerberg blamed himself for the inability to control the device, but the ringtone continued to play across a deathly-silent hall, despite his best efforts.</p><p>Eventually, the Meta head honcho gave up. "I don't know what to tell you guys," he said, eventually resorting to bringing the now much-awaited Boz onstage, amid a seemingly ever-present ringtone and much tittering from the crowd.</p><figure><div></div><figcaption><span>(Image credit: Meta Developers)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I'll be honest, it's a pretty painful watch. As tempting as it is to make fun of <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/profiles/mark-e-zuckerberg/">Meta's multi-billionaire CEO</a> for the borked demo, those of us who have had to present live ourselves will have our head in our hands, as I have while writing this article. It seems the Ray-Ban Meta glasses could do with <em>some work,</em> and while the tech looks very impressive on paper, the demo appears to have revealed some serious flaws in the implementation.</p><p>I can't imagine many will be rushing to order a pair after this particular demonstration, but I can't help but think of another old showbiz clich&eacute;: There's no such thing as bad PR. We're all talking about it at least, and that's the main thing, eh Zuck?<em> </em></p></div><div><p>Andy built his first gaming PC at the tender age of 12, when IDE cables were a thing and high resolution wasn't&mdash;and he hasn't stopped since.

This is how a four-year-old mourns a goldfish.&rdquo;</p><p>The quips drew outrage on the right. FCC Chair Brendan Carr accused Kimmel of lying to the American public and suggested the commission could take regulatory action against ABC. &ldquo;We can do this the easy way or the hard way,&rdquo; Carr said on a podcast hosted by far-right commentator Benny Johnson, in remarks that carried unmistakable menace. Hours later, Disney chief executive Robert Iger and television chief Dana Walden decided to pull Kimmel&rsquo;s show indefinitely, the <em><em>New York Times</em></em> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/17/business/media/abc-jimmy-kimmel.html">reports</a>.</p><p><strong>Related: </strong><a href="https://www.advocate.com/news/charlie-kirk-dead-utah-shooting">Right-wing firebrand Charlie Kirk dead after shooting at university in Utah</a></p><p>The sequence of events amounts to a chilling exertion of political pressure on a major broadcast network &mdash; a move critics say undermines the very notion of a free press and the First Amendment.

Trump, traveling in Britain, posted on social media that the development was &ldquo;Great News for America.&rdquo;</p><p>After Carr&rsquo;s threat, affiliate owners quickly fell in line. Nexstar Media Group, which is pursuing a $6.2 billion merger under FCC review, announced it would pre-empt Kimmel &ldquo;for the foreseeable future.&rdquo; Sinclair Broadcast Group, which espouses conservative values, soon followed, demanding an apology to Kirk&rsquo;s family and a donation to Turning Point USA.

It applies to all residents of Michigan, adults or children, targets an extensive range of content and includes language that could ban not <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/best-vpn-for-streaming/">only VPNs</a> but any method of bypassing internet filters or restrictions.&nbsp;</p><p>That could spell trouble for <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/best-vpn-for-windows/">VPN owners</a> and other internet users who leverage these tools to improve their privacy, protect their identities online, prevent ISPs from gathering data about them or <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/best-antivirus/">increase their device safety</a> when browsing on public Wi-Fi.</p><p><strong>Read more</strong>: <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/vpn-survey-2025">CNET Survey: 47% of Americans Use VPNs for Privacy. That Number Could Rise. Here's Why</a></p><p>Bills like these could have unintended side effects. John Perrino, Senior Policy and Advocacy Expert for the nonprofit&nbsp;<a href="https://www.internetsociety.org">Internet Society</a>, mentioned to CNET that adult content laws like this could interfere with what kind of music people can stream, the sexual health forums and articles they can access and even important news involving sexual topics that they may want to read.</p><p>&nbsp;"Additionally, state age verification laws are difficult for smaller services to comply with, hurting competition and an open internet," Perrino said.</p><p>The Anticorruption of Public Morals Act has not passed the Michigan House of Representatives committee or been voted on by the Michigan Senate, and it's not clear how much support the bill has beyond the six Republican representatives who have proposed it. As we've seen with state legislation in the past, sometimes bills like these can serve as templates for other representatives who may want to propose similar laws in their own states.</p><h2>Could VPNs still get around bans like these?</h2><figure><div><picture><source srcset="https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/41689d3f88079acf6ad3a417e082f29964f9d62c/hub/2025/08/22/6281cb39-862d-4a0d-99fd-e226c2cc9ee4/pia-vpn-review-multi-hop.png?auto=webp&amp;width=768" alt="PIA VPN multi-hop and obfuscation servers"><source srcset="https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/459e6591c269b78c9212ae6fb03b8fc2b8d210f3/hub/2025/08/22/6281cb39-862d-4a0d-99fd-e226c2cc9ee4/pia-vpn-review-multi-hop.png?auto=webp&amp;width=1024" alt="PIA VPN multi-hop and obfuscation servers"><source srcset="https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/602336d83849d66df682b32feaf4177cad136f83/hub/2025/08/22/6281cb39-862d-4a0d-99fd-e226c2cc9ee4/pia-vpn-review-multi-hop.png?auto=webp&amp;width=1200" alt="PIA VPN multi-hop and obfuscation servers"> <img src="https://www.cnet.com" alt="PIA VPN multi-hop and obfuscation servers" height="826.3229308005427" width="1200"></source></source></source></picture></div><figcaption> <span>Screenshot by CNET</span></figcaption></figure><p>Could VPNs still get around this type of ban? That's a complex question that this bill doesn't really address.&nbsp;</p><p>"From a technical standpoint, ISPs can attempt to distinguish VPN traffic using deep packet inspection, or they can block known VPN IP addresses," said <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/nordvpn-review/">NordVPN privacy advocate Laura Tyrylyte</a>. "However, deploying them effectively requires big investments and ongoing maintenance, making large-scale VPN blocking both costly and complex."</p><p>Also, VPNs have ways around deep packet inspection and other methods.&nbsp;</p><p>"Some VPNs offer&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/vpn-obfuscation-what-it-is-and-why-you-might-need-it/">obfuscation</a>&nbsp;-- which tries to disguise VPN traffic as standard web traffic -- using dedicated servers or custom VPN protocols, like <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/nordvpn-review/">NordVPN's</a> NordWhisper or Proton VPN's Stealth," said CNET senior editor Moe Long. "But note that obfuscation isn't foolproof."</p><p>There are also no-log features offered by many VPNs to guarantee they don't keep a record of your activity, and <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/nordvpn-backs-up-its-no-log-claims-with-a-new-audit-from-deloitte">no-log audits from third parties like Deloitte</a> that -- well, <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/vpn-audits-are-important-but-they-dont-paint-a-full-picture/">try to guarantee the guarantee</a>.

That, in turn, prompted one group of ABC affiliates, owned by Nexstar Media Group, to declare they will not air <em>Jimmy Kimmel Live!</em> for the immediate future, which then led ABC to announce the show was being taken off the air &ldquo;indefinitely.&rdquo; </p><p>The uproar started after Kimmel said suspected Kirk assassin Tyler Robinson was a MAGA Republican. &ldquo;We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it,&rdquo; Kimmel said. </p><p>Carr was interviewed by <a href="https://x.com/bennyjohnson/status/1968359685045838041">YouTuber</a> <a href="https://x.com/bennyjohnson/status/1968359685045838041">Benny Johnson</a> on Wednesday (video also below), where he appeared to threaten ABC affiliate licenses over the comments, which he called &ldquo;the sickest conduct possible.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;[This] appears to be an action by Jimmy Kimmel to play into the narrative that this was somehow a MAGA or Republican-motivated person,&rdquo; Carr said. &ldquo;What people don&rsquo;t understand is that the broadcasters &hellip; have a license granted by us at the FCC, and that comes with it an obligation to operate in the public interest. When we see stuff like this, look, we can do this the easy way or the hard way. These companies can find ways to change conduct, on Kimmel, or there&rsquo;s going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.&rdquo;</p><p>Johnson said he&rsquo;d like to see an apology from Kimmel to Kirk and his family and asked Carr what other punitive steps the FCC might take. </p><p>&ldquo;I think what you said strikes me as a very reasonable, minimal step that can be taken,&rdquo; Carr said. &ldquo;Calls for Kimmel to be fired &mdash; I think, you could certainly see a path forward for a suspension over this. You know, the FCC is going to have remedies.&rdquo;</p><p>Carr then ran down some of the media earthquakes that have transpired under the second Trump administration, from Stephen Colbert&rsquo;s <em>The Late Show</em> being canceled next year, to NPR and PBS being defunded, to CBS News taking steps to be more &ldquo;fact based.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So I think you see some lashing out from people like Kimmel, who are frankly talentless and are looking for ways to get attention,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Their grip on the narrative is slipping. That doesn&rsquo;t mean that it&rsquo;s not still important to hold the public interest standard &hellip; We have a rule on the book that interprets the public interest standard that says &lsquo;news distortion&rsquo; is something that is prohibited &hellip; the FCC has stepped back from enforcing it &hellip; I think it&rsquo;s past time these [affiliates] themselves push back on Comcast and this and say, &lsquo;Listen, we&rsquo;re not going to run Kimmel anymore until you straighten this out because we&rsquo;re running the possibility of license revocation from the FCC if we continue to run content that ends up being a pattern of news distortion.&rsquo; So I think again, Disney needs to see some change here.&rdquo; (Note: Comcast owns NBC Universal; Disney owns ABC.)</p><p>Nexstar then issued the following statement in response to Carr&rsquo;s comments: &ldquo;Nexstar&rsquo;s owned and partner television stations affiliated with the ABC Television Network will preempt <em>Jimmy Kimmel Live!</em> for the foreseeable future beginning with tonight&rsquo;s show. Nexstar strongly objects to recent comments made by Mr. Kimmel concerning the killing of Charlie Kirk and will replace the show with other programming in its ABC-affiliated markets.&rdquo; Nexstar currently operates 28 ABC affiliates across the country, mostly in small or midsize markets, though they include the ABC stations in New Orleans and Salt Lake City. </p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Kimmel&rsquo;s comments about the death of Mr. Kirk are o&#64256;ensive and insensitive at a critical time in our national political discourse, and we do not believe they reflect the spectrum of opinions, views, or values of the local communities in which we are located,&rdquo; added Andrew Alford, President of Nexstar&rsquo;s broadcasting division. &ldquo;Continuing to give Mr. Kimmel a broadcast platform in the communities we serve is simply not in the public interest at the current time, and we have made the di&#64259;cult decision to preempt his show in an e&#64256;ort to let cooler heads prevail as we move toward the resumption of respectful, constructive dialogue.&rdquo;</p><div><p>The affiliate group pulling Kimmel was quickly followed by ABC announcing the show had been suspended. A network spokesperson said&nbsp;<em>Jimmy Kimmel Live!</em>&nbsp;will be &ldquo;pre-empted indefinitely.&rdquo;</p><p>Yet Carr&rsquo;s tactics drew fire from within the department itself as FCC Commissioner Anna Gomez responded on social media by criticizing the Chair&rsquo;s threats.</p></div><p>&ldquo;An inexcusable act of political violence by one disturbed individual must never be exploited as justification for broader censorship or control,&rdquo; <a href="https://x.com/AGomezFCC/status/1968406707484144057">Gomez wrote</a>. &ldquo;This Administration is increasingly using the weight of government power to suppress lawful expression, not because it glorifies violence or breaks the law, but because it challenges those in power or reflects views they oppose.&nbsp;We must stand firm against every attempt to silence dissent, punish satirists and government critics, and erode individual liberty. To surrender our right to speak freely is to accept that those in power, not the people, will set the boundaries of debate that define a free society.&rdquo;</p><figure></figure> <figure><p><iframe title="Jimmy Kimmel LIES About Charlie Kirk Killer, Blames Charlie For His Murder!?

"To prevent future radicalization and violence, the CEOs of Discord, Steam, Twitch, and Reddit must appear before the Oversight Committee and explain what actions they will take to ensure their platforms are not exploited for nefarious purposes."</p><p>Letters from the House Oversight Committee have been sent to Humam Sakhnini, CEO of Discord; Gabe Newell, president of Steam maker Valve; Dan Clancy, CEO of Twitch; and Steve Huffman, CEO of Reddit, requesting their testimony on Oct. 8. "The hearing will examine radicalization of online forum users, including incidents of open incitement to commit violent politically motivated acts," Comer said in a letter to each CEO.</p><p>The catalyst for Comer's request is the killing of Charlie Kirk, the right-wing political activist and media personality who was shot at Utah Valley University last week. The suspect in that case, Tyler Robinson, is <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2025/09/15/charlie-kirk-shooter-suspect-discord-chat/">reported to have used Discord</a> to discuss the killing after the fact, and is alleged to have been <a href="https://www.polygon.com/charlie-kirk-shooter-helldivers-2-meme-tyler-robinson/">steeped in online meme culture</a>.</p><p>Steam and Discord have long been homes for extremists to gather, coordinate, and harass their perceived enemies, despite both platforms being aimed at gamers and designed originally for non-political purposes. The 2017 white supremacist rally Unite the Right in Charlottesville, Virginia was planned through Discord, and the platform was used by far-right mass shooters in the 2022 Buffalo shooting and the Highland Park Parade shooting. In 2024, the <a href="https://www.adl.org/resources/report/steam-powered-hate-top-gaming-site-rife-extremism-antisemitism">Anti-Defamation League</a> reported that Steam was "rife with extremism and antisemitism" across Steam Community groups.

In 2024, ProPublica reported that Honey had played a key role in Mitchell’s behind-the-scenes effort to change Georgia’s election rules to allow Republican officials to contest a potential Trump loss in that year’s presidential race. Honey also promoted election conspiracy theories, including one Trump cited in a speech to his followers before they stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.</p><p>Though states do the on-the-ground work of running elections, DHS supports them with tasks beyond their capacities, such as protecting IT infrastructure and voter databases from foreign intrusions. The agency, with bipartisan support, took on this role in the aftermath of Russia’s interference in the 2016 election.</p><p>Experts on voting and state election officials warned that Honey’s appointment as DHS’ deputy assistant secretary of election integrity could erode trust between state and federal officials, prompting states not to share information with the agency.</p><p>“We are witnessing a dangerous trend: the elevation of known bad-faith actors like Heather Honey,” said Adrian Fontes, Arizona’s Democratic secretary of state, in a statement, citing Honey’s “well-documented history of spreading election lies that have been debunked in court.”</p><p>Fontes called her involvement with DHS “deeply troubling” and said “when the agency gives a platform to individuals who have actively worked to erode public trust, it becomes harder to view DHS as a reliable partner in election security.”</p><p>A DHS spokesperson did not answer questions from ProPublica on Honey’s appointment or the exact nature of her responsibilities. Honey didn’t respond to calls or emails. The White House also didn’t respond to a request for comment. Her name is listed on the organization’s leadership structure online, and her appointment was first reported by the website Democracy Docket.</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1njcwto/she_pushed_to_overturn_the_loss_in_the_2020/nep852u/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not who votes that counts.
