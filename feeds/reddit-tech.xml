His monologue suggested Trump supporters were trying to reframe the shooter&rsquo;s political ties, which drew backlash from the FCC and major ABC affiliates. ABC replaced the program with reruns, sparking accusations of censorship and igniting a boycott campaign against Disney, its parent company.</p><h2><strong>Overwhelming public reaction</strong></h2><p>The suspension triggered strong responses across social media and beyond. Hashtags like #CancelDisneyPlus and #CancelHulu trended as users shared screenshots of their canceled subscriptions.</p><figure><figcaption><p>Disney+ faced cancellation surges after Jimmy Kimmel&rsquo;s suspension sparked boycotts.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Lawmakers, unions, and advocacy groups joined the conversation, framing the move as an attack on free expression rather than a programming choice.</p><h2><strong>&ldquo;The page &hellip; keeps crashing&rdquo;</strong></h2><p>With cancellations surging, many subscribers reported technical issues. On <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fauxmoi/comments/1nkm8h9/disney_executives_and_jimmy_kimmel_are_meeting/">Reddit&rsquo;s r/Fauxmoi</a>, one post read, &ldquo;The page to cancel your Hulu/Disney+ subscription keeps crashing.&rdquo;</p><figure><div><dialog></dialog></div><figcaption><p>Both Hulu and Disney+ saw spikes in cancellations as viewers protested Kimmel&rsquo;s suspension.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Another added, &ldquo;Already cancelled my <a href="https://creators.yahoo.com/lifestyle/story/5-outfits-that-will-for-sure-get-you-kicked-out-of-disneyland-only-your-kids-are-allowed-to-wear-the-1st-one-170556131.html">Disney</a> subscription,&rdquo; while others said they faced looping logins and stalled forms. These firsthand accounts suggest Disney&rsquo;s systems struggled under the unusual traffic volume.</p><h2><strong>Affiliate pressure and scheduling changes</strong></h2><p>Affiliate owners played a direct role in the fallout. Sinclair announced it would air a Charlie Kirk tribute special during Kimmel&rsquo;s slot and demanded an apology, while Nexstar also refused to broadcast new episodes.</p><p>Some local stations filled the timeslot with local news or alternative programming instead of reruns, widening the impact beyond one network show.</p><h2><strong>Why people are canceling</strong></h2><p>For many, the suspension represents a larger issue. Critics argue Disney and ABC bowed to political pressure at the expense of free speech.</p><p>A Reddit user summed up the sentiment: &ldquo;If they don&rsquo;t apologize to high heavens to him, we all need to continue to boycott all Disney &amp; ABC services, including Hulu.&rdquo; Posts like this echo the frustration fueling subscription losses.</p><h2><strong>Next steps for subscribers and Disney</strong></h2><p>If you want to cancel, try clearing cookies, switching browsers, or using Disney&rsquo;s live chat for confirmation if the cancellation flow freezes. Always keep screenshots of your request and watch billing cycles to confirm the change processed.</p><figure><figcaption><p>Disney+ subscribers reported cancellation pages crashing as they tried to quit in protest.</p></figcaption></figure><p>For Disney, the challenge is bigger: balancing affiliate demands, political scrutiny, and customer trust while subscription churn becomes public proof of consumer backlash.</p><h2><strong>The bottom line</strong></h2><p>What began as a late-night monologue has escalated into a company-wide flashpoint. Disney now faces mounting cancellations, technical strain on its cancellation page, and reputational fallout tied to questions of censorship and free speech.</p><p>As one Reddit user noted, &ldquo;I also cancelled my Disney+ today after deciding there is no way for me to return.&rdquo; Whether Disney reinstates Kimmel or holds the line, the decision will shape not just its brand but its subscriber base moving forward.</p></div><div class="gallery"><p><img src="https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/YYxA6N2NVbFT1zh7tJSvcw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTUwMjtjZj13ZWJw/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-09/79e9a3b0-9507-11f0-adff-45492b5d7fc4"></p><p><img src="https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/aDIWsizCeuH98yWYgsu5OQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTQ5MjtjZj13ZWJw/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-09/cc762590-9507-11f0-9fdf-ecc19123d063"></p><p><img src="https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/43Y_YZEn4VgLQ9IMrovY4Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTYzOTtjZj13ZWJw/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-09/f87b1be0-9508-11f0-9757-18700a000867"></p></div></section><section class='separator separator-before-comments'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='comments'><p>Top comments</p><ol><li><div class="md"><p>Starve the Mouse</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1nlju03/disney_cancellation_page_crashes_as_customers/nf5zvlz/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><div class="md"><p>Here we go: <a href="https://secure.hulu.com/account/cancel">https://secure.hulu.com/account/cancel</a></p><p><a href="https://www.disneyplus.com/account/cancel-subscription">https://www.disneyplus.com/account/cancel-subscription</a></p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1nlju03/disney_cancellation_page_crashes_as_customers/nf60rkm/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><div class="md"><p>Oh no, that’s terrible.</p><p>Let’s try <a href="https://help.disneyplus.com/en-GB/contact-us">contacting their support about it</a>.</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1nlju03/disney_cancellation_page_crashes_as_customers/nf60cg7/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p></li></ol></section>]]></description><pubDate>Sat, 20 Sep 2025 05:45:30 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/after-getting-jimmy-kimmel-suspended-fcc-chair-threatens-abcs-the-view/</link><title>After getting Jimmy Kimmel suspended, FCC chair threatens ABC's The View | Carr: "Turn your license in to the FCC, we'll find something else to do with it."

Jennings asked Carr whether <em>The View</em> and other ABC programs violate FCC rules, and made a reference to President Trump calling on NBC to cancel Fallon and Meyers.</p><p>"A lot of people think there are other shows on ABC that maybe run afoul of this more often than Jimmy Kimmel," Jennings said. "I'm thinking specifically of <em>The View</em>, and President Trump himself has mentioned Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers at NBC. Do you have comments on those shows, and are they doing what Kimmel did Monday night, and is it even worse on those programs in your opinion?"</p><p>In response, Carr discussed the FCC's Equal Opportunities Rule, also known as the Equal Time Rule, and said the FCC could determine that those shows don't qualify for an exemption to the rule.</p><p>"When you look at these other TV shows, what's interesting is the FCC does have a rule called the Equal Opportunity Rule, which means, for instance, if you're in the run-up to an election and you have one partisan elected official on, you have to give equal time, equal opportunity, to the opposing partisan politician," Carr said.</p><p>At another point in the interview, Carr said broadcasters that object to FCC enforcement "can turn your license in to the FCC, we'll find something else to do with it."</p><h2>Bona fide news exemption</h2><p>Carr said the FCC hasn't previously enforced the rule on those shows because of an exemption for "bona fide news" programs. He said the FCC could determine the shows mentioned by Jennings aren't exempt:</p><blockquote><p>There's an exception to that rule called the bona fide news exception, which means if you are a bona fide news program, you don't have to abide by the Equal Opportunity Rule. Over the years, the FCC has developed a body of case law on that that has suggested that most of these late night shows, other than <em>SNL</em>, are bona fide news programs. I would assume you could make the argument that <em>The View</em> is a bona fide news show but I'm not so sure about that, and I think it's worthwhile to have the FCC look into whether <em>The View</em> and some of these other programs you have still qualify as bona fide news programs and [are] therefore exempt from the Equal Opportunity regime that Congress has put in place.</p></blockquote><p>The Equal Opportunity Rule applies to radio and TV broadcast stations with FCC licenses to use the airwaves. An <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/sites/default/files/political_programming_fact_sheet.pdf">FCC fact sheet</a> explains that stations giving time to one candidate must provide "comparable time and placement to opposing candidates" upon request. The onus is on candidates to request air time&mdash;"the station is not required to seek out opposing legally qualified candidates and offer them Equal Opportunities," the fact sheet says.</p></div><div><p>The exemption mentioned by Carr means that "appearances by legally qualified candidates on bona fide newscasts, interview programs, certain types of news documentaries, and during on-the-spot coverage of bona fide news events are exempt from Equal Opportunities," the fact sheet says.</p><p>In 1994, the FCC <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DA-94-1196A1.pdf">said</a> that "Congress removed the inhibiting effect of the equal opportunities obligation upon bona fide news programming to encourage increased news coverage of political campaign activity." Congress gave the FCC leeway to interpret the scope of bona fide news exemptions.</p><p>Referring to its 1988 ruling on <em>Entertainment Tonight</em> and <em>Entertainment This Week</em>, the FCC said it found that "the principal consideration should be 'whether the program reports news of some area of current events... in a manner similar to more traditional newscasts.' The Commission has thus declined to evaluate the relative quality or significance of the topics and stories selected for newscast coverage, relying instead on the broadcaster's good faith news judgment."</p><h2>Carr&rsquo;s allegations</h2><p>Carr <a href="https://x.com/BrendanCarrFCC/status/1852887210330341693">alleged</a> in November 2024 that NBC putting Kamala Harris on <em>Saturday Night Live</em> before the election was "a clear and blatant effort to evade the FCC's Equal Time rule." In fact, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2024-11-04/trump-campaign-gets-equal-time-from-nbc-after-harris-snl-appearance">NBC gave Trump</a> two free 60-second messages in order to comply with the rule.</p><p>Carr didn't cite any specific incidents on <em>The View</em> or late-night shows that would violate the FCC rule. <em>The View</em> has addressed its attempts to get Trump on the show, however. Executive Producer Brian Teta <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/04/the-view-executive-producer-brian-teta-2024-election-1235875936/">told Deadline</a> in April 2024, "We've invited Trump to join us at the table for both 2016 and 2020 elections, and he declined, and at a certain point, we stopped asking. So I don't anticipate that changing. I think he's pretty familiar with how the co-hosts feel about him and doesn't see himself coming here."</p><p>The Kimmel controversy erupted over a monologue in which he said, "We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and with everything they can to score political points from it."</p></div><div><p>With accused murderer Tyler Robinson being described as having liberal views, Carr and other conservatives alleged that Kimmel misled viewers. Carr appeared on right-wing commentator Benny Johnson's <a href="https://youtu.be/uTyX9JC-rhA?t=512">podcast</a> on Wednesday and said, "We can do this the easy way or the hard way. These companies can find ways to change conduct, to take action, frankly on Kimmel, or there's going to be additional work for the FCC ahead."</p><p>Nexstar and Sinclair, two major owners of TV stations, both urged ABC to take action against Kimmel and said their stations would not air his show. The pressure from broadcasters is happening at a time when both <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/broadcaster-fcc-abolish-national-tv-ownership-rule-1236496159/">Nexstar</a> and ABC owner <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-23/doj-probes-disney-fubo-deal-over-competition-concerns">Disney</a> are seeking Trump administration approval for mergers.</p><h2>Democrats accuse Carr of hypocrisy on First Amendment</h2><p>Anna Gomez, the only Democrat on the Republican-majority FCC, said yesterday that Carr overstepped his authority, but "billion-dollar companies with pending business before the agency" are "vulnerable to pressure to bend to the government's ideological demands."</p><p>Democratic lawmakers criticized Carr and <a href="https://democrats-energycommerce.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/democrats-energycommerce.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/sept-2025-fcc-oig-letter-re-censorship-and-abuse-of-office.pdf">proposed</a> investigations into the chair for abuse of authority. "It is not simply unacceptable for the FCC chairman to threaten a media organization because he does not like the content of its programming&mdash;it violates the First Amendment that you claim to champion," Senate Democrats wrote in a <a href="https://www.commerce.senate.gov/services/files/82175836-7A72-4746-83B6-6CFFCC0A7A53">letter</a> to Carr. "The FCC's role in overseeing the public airwaves does not give it the power to act as a roving press censor, targeting broadcasters based on their political commentary. But under your leadership, the FCC is being weaponized to do precisely that."</p><p>Democrats pointed to some of Carr's previous statements in which he decried government censorship. During his 2023 re-confirmation proceedings, Senate Democrats asked Carr about social media posts in which he accused Democrats of engaging in censorship like "what you'd see in the Soviet Union."</p><p>"I posted those tweets in the context of expressing my view on the First Amendment that debate on matters of public interest should be robust, uninhibited, and wide open," <a href="https://www.commerce.senate.gov/services/files/8219EE1F-3043-41F0-B1A1-46456C5F295A">Carr wrote in his response to Democratic senators</a>. "I believe that the best remedy to speech that someone does not like or finds objectionable is more speech. I posted them because I believe that a newsroom's decision about what stories to cover and how to frame them should, consistent with the First Amendment, be beyond the reach of any government official."</p></div><div><p>Years earlier, in 2019, Carr posted a <a href="https://x.com/BrendanCarrFCC/status/1096062915201953795">tweet</a> that said, "Should the government censor speech it doesn't like? Of course not. The FCC does not have a roving mandate to police speech in the name of the 'public interest.'"</p><p>Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) also <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/19/ted-cruz-jimmy-kimmel-fcc-carr-mafia.html">criticized</a> Carr's approach, saying it would lead to the same tactics being used against Republicans the next time Democrats are in power.</p><h2>Carr to broadcasters: Give your licenses back to FCC</h2><p>Carr said this week he's only addressing licensed broadcasters, which have public-interest obligations, as opposed to cable and streaming services that don't need FCC licenses. Network programming itself doesn't need an FCC license, but the TV stations that carry network shows require licenses.</p><p>Carr tried to cast Kimmel's suspension as the result of organic pressure from licensed broadcasters, rather than FCC coercion. "There's no untoward coercion happening here," Carr told Jennings. "The market was intended to function this way, where local TV stations get to push back."</p><p>But TV station owners did so in exactly the way that Carr urged them to. "The individual licensed stations that are taking their content, it's time for them to step up and say this garbage isn't something that we think serves the needs of our local communities," Carr said on Johnson's podcast. Carr said that Kimmel's monologue "appears to be some of the sickest conduct possible."</p><p>On the Jennings show, Carr alleged that Democrats in the previous administration implemented "a two-tiered weaponized system of justice," and that his FCC is instead giving everyone "a fair shake and even-handed treatment."</p><p>Carr has repeatedly threatened broadcasters with the FCC's rarely enforced news distortion policy. As we've <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/trumps-fcc-chair-invokes-rarely-enforced-news-distortion-policy-to-punish-media/">explained</a>, the FCC technically has no rule or regulation against news distortion, which is why it is called a policy and not a rule. But on Jennings' show, he described it as a rule.</p></div><div><div><p>"We do have those rules at the FCC: If you engage in news distortion, we can take action," Carr said.</p><p>As we've written several times, it is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/12/trumps-fcc-chair-can-hassle-the-living-daylights-out-of-news-broadcasters/">difficult legally</a> for the FCC to revoke broadcast licenses. But it isn't difficult for Carr to exert pressure on networks and broadcasters through public statements. Carr suggested yesterday that broadcasters turn in their licenses if they don't like his approach to enforcement.</p><p>"If you're a broadcaster and you don't like being held accountable for the first time in a long time through the public interest standard, that's fine. You can turn your license in to the FCC, we'll find something else to do with it," Carr said. "Or you can go to Congress and say, 'I don't want the FCC having public interest obligations on broadcasters anymore, I want broadcasters to be like cable, to be like a streaming service.' That's fine too. But as long as that's the system that Congress has created, we're going to enforce it."</p></div><div><div><p>Jon is a Senior IT Reporter for Ars Technica.

Here&rsquo;s a summary of today&rsquo;s developments:</p><ul> <li><p><strong>The federal prosecutor for the eastern district of Virginia resigned Friday under intense pressure from Donald Trump</strong>, after his office determined there wasn&rsquo;t sufficient evidence to charge New York&rsquo;s attorney general, Letitia James, a political rival of the president, with a crime. Erik Siebert told colleagues he was resigning in a letter sent Friday, NBC News reported. Hours earlier, Trump bluntly told reporters in the Oval Office: &ldquo;I want him out.&rdquo; The president claimed he soured on Siebert because Virginia&rsquo;s two Democratic senators had endorsed his nomination, but also claimed that James &ldquo;is very guilty of something&rdquo;. ABC News reported earlier on Friday that Trump decided to fire Siebert after he failed to obtain an indictment against James.

The US commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, said at a Friday press briefing that &ldquo;all the big companies&rdquo; had been briefed on the new fee.

The justice department filed an emergency application asking the justices to lift a federal judge&rsquo;s ruling that the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, lacked the authority to end the protections for Venezuelans under the temporary protected status, or TPS, program.

Funding expires at the end of September, and with congressional lawmakers on recess next week, the threat of a shutdown is perilously close.</p></li> <li><p><strong>In response, legislators from both sides of the aisle </strong><strong>spent the day shirking blame and claiming the other party would be responsible for a shutdown on 1 October.</strong> Senate majority leader John Thune said: &ldquo;Democrats are yielding to the desires of their rabidly leftist base and are attempting to hold government funding hostage to a long list of partisan demands.&rdquo; His counterpart, Chuck Schumer, said that Republicans &ldquo;want&rdquo; the shutdown to happen. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re in the majority. They don&rsquo;t negotiate, they cause the shutdown &ndash; plain and simple,&rdquo; he said.</p></li> <li><p><strong>A resolution honoring murdered </strong><strong>rightwing activist Charlie Kirk passed the House of Representatives with bipartisan support</strong>, but only after causing considerable consternation among Democrats. All Republicans in attendance voted in favor of the resolution, which describes Kirk as &ldquo;a courageous American patriot, whose life was tragically and unjustly cut short in an act of political violence&rdquo;. Ninety-five Democrats supported the resolution, while 58 opposed it. Several Democrats who opposed the resolution said they condemned Kirk&rsquo;s murder, and political violence at large, but could not support a figure who used his speech.

He gave Trump 28 days to file an amended complaint, and reminded the administration it was &ldquo;not a protected platform to rage against an adversary&rdquo;.

A lower court judge had blocked the policy earlier this year, and an appeals court let the judge&rsquo;s ruling stay in place.

The response from Republican commentators has been <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/politics-news/maga-reaction-jimmy-kimmel-suspension-1236374491/">predictably gleeful</a>. They&rsquo;ve positioned the suspension as a reversal of &ldquo;cancel culture,&rdquo; a &ldquo;deplatforming&rdquo; that&rsquo;s simply fair retaliation for antagonizing them. &ldquo;Jimmy Kimmel does have Free Speech, he is free to speak just not on ABC,&rdquo; posted comedian <a href="https://x.com/w_terrence/status/1968521190693019710">Terrence Kentrell Williams on X</a>.</p><p>This framing is transparently false. ABC&rsquo;s suspension of Kimmel was the result of an explicit threat from President Donald Trump&rsquo;s Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr, aimed at Disney and companies that worked with it. The move was effective because of the FCC&rsquo;s authority to regulate broadcast TV and, perhaps more importantly, to approve communications mergers in a hyper-consolidated landscape. It was repeating a playbook Carr recently used on Disney&rsquo;s fellow media giant Paramount. And it&rsquo;s an unabashed attempt at the government dictating the speech of private TV networks and entertainers, as objectionable and un-American as a McCarthyist blacklist.</p><p>The starting point of all this is a pretty tame late-night show monologue. On Monday, Kimmel said the following:</p><p>&ldquo;We hit some new lows over the weekend, with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it.&rdquo;</p><p>The line led into a clip from last week in which Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/16/arts/television/late-night-trump-white-house-ballroom.html">responded to Kirk&rsquo;s death</a> by bragging about the new White House ballroom &mdash; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s at the fourth stage of grief: construction,&rdquo; Kimmel quipped.</p><p>Carr and other Republicans loudly interpreted the remark as claiming Tyler Robinson, who&rsquo;s charged with killing Kirk, was part of MAGA. (An <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/09/16/us/tyler-robinson-charges.html">indictment released</a> Tuesday says Robinson believed Kirk was spreading &ldquo;hate&rdquo;; at the time of Kimmel&rsquo;s monologue, the evidence was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/politics/777313/charlie-kirks-alleged-killer-scratched-bullets-with-a-helldivers-combo-and-a-furry-sex-meme">mostly confusing</a> and speculation was rife.)</p><p>On Wednesday, Carr <a href="https://x.com/bennyjohnson/status/1968359685045838041">appeared in high dudgeon</a> for an interview with conservative commentator Benny Johnson. &ldquo;It appears to be some of the sickest conduct possible,&rdquo; Carr intoned over a clip of Kimmel&rsquo;s statement. It was also, he said, legally actionable. Broadcasters &ldquo;have a license granted by us at the FCC, and that comes with an obligation to operate in the public interest,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We can do this the easy way or the hard way. These companies can find ways to change conduct and take action, frankly, on Kimmel, or there&rsquo;s going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.&rdquo;</p><p>Carr and Johnson walked out the threat a little further. They noted that Disney and ABC aren&rsquo;t issued a central license to broadcast; licenses are granted to individual TV stations, owned in small numbers by Disney but mainly by separate companies that broadcast ABC and other networks&rsquo; programming. &ldquo;FCC regulatory action focuses on these individual stations,&rdquo; Carr noted. &ldquo;The public interest means you can&rsquo;t be running a narrow partisan circus and still meeting your public interest obligations.&rdquo;</p><p>Citing rules against &ldquo;news distortion&rdquo; and &ldquo;broadcast hoaxes,&rdquo; Carr repeated that &ldquo;there&rsquo;s actions we can take on licensed broadcasters. And frankly, I think it&rsquo;s really past time that a lot of these licensed broadcasters themselves push back on Comcast and Disney and say, &lsquo;Listen, we are going to preempt, we are not going to run Kimmel anymore until you straighten this out, because we, a licensed broadcaster, are running the possibility of fines or license revocation from the FCC if we continue to run content that ends up being a pattern of news distortion.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>This is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24283652/fcc-license-donald-trump-elon-musk-first-amendment-fairness-doctrine-please-vote-decoder">not how any pre-Carr FCC in recent memory</a> (or arguably before that) has defined the &ldquo;public interest&rdquo; requirement. If the issue is a &ldquo;narrow partisan circus,&rdquo; the highly partisan Fox &mdash; whose news division <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/18/23688582/fox-dominion-election-defamation-lawsuit-settled-trial-averted">settled a massive defamation suit</a> for lying about voting machine companies in 2023 &mdash; has been a stolid fixture on TV stations across the country for decades. Carr invoked rules against &ldquo;news distortion&rdquo; and &ldquo;broadcast hoaxes,&rdquo; neither of which makes logical sense as a charge against Kimmel. The bar for stripping a license is typically high &mdash; a rare example is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1979/12/07/archives/black-group-is-awarded-license-for-television-station-in.html">the 1969 revocation</a> of aggressively pro-segregationist station WLBT, which among other things, blacked out broadcasts involving civil rights.</p><p>Some commentators on the left <em>have </em>pushed for the FCC to do what Carr threatened, just with Fox instead of ABC, particularly <a href="https://prospect.org/blogs-and-newsletters/tap/2023-08-28-will-fox-lose-its-broadcast-license/">after the defamation settlement</a>. But the FCC has never pulled a station&rsquo;s license as a result of this urging, and <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/09/brendan-carr-jimmy-kimmel-public-interest-1236547721/">in 2019 Carr decried</a> even Democratic commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel&rsquo;s suggestion they crack down on TV and radio e-cigarette ads, saying the FCC &ldquo;does not have a roving mandate to police speech in the name of the &lsquo;public interest.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>Carr&rsquo;s statement on Wednesday was unambiguous: ABC-affiliated TV stations needed to stop airing Kimmel&rsquo;s show ASAP, or they could be fined or lose their license. And the stations&rsquo; parent companies were listening. Nexstar, which owns around 200 stations and reaches roughly 39 percent of US households, <a href="https://www.nexstar.tv/nexstar-abc-affiliates-to-preempt-jimmy-kimmel-live-indefinitely-beginning-tonight/">said quickly</a> that it would no longer air <em>Jimmy Kimmel Live</em>. So did <a href="https://sbgi.net/sinclair-says-kimmel-suspension-is-not-enough-calls-on-fcc-and-abc-to-take-additional-action/">fellow giant Sinclair Broadcast Group</a>.</p><p>Those companies, particularly Nexstar, have reasons beyond station licensing to keep Carr happy. Nexstar is pushing for a $6.2 billion merger with broadcaster Tegna that would require the FCC to loosen the rules on TV station consolidation, something CEO Perry Sook <a href="https://www.newscaststudio.com/2025/08/22/nexstar-ceo-perry-sook-defends-6-2b-tegna-acquisition-as-regulatory-shift-creates-opening/">has expressed hope</a> that Trump&rsquo;s &ldquo;deregulatory moment&rdquo; will enable.</p><p>Carr has shown himself willing to slow-walk deals with companies that earn his ire. A merger between Paramount and Skydance was not approved until Paramount subsidiary CBS <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/696422/paramount-settlement-trump-cbs-lawsuit">agreed to pay $16 million</a> to resolve a blatantly frivolous lawsuit filed by Trump. It proceeded on the grounds that Skydance promote a &ldquo;diversity of viewpoints from across the political and ideological spectrum&rdquo; and employ an ombudsman who would &ldquo;receive and evaluate any complaints of bias or other concerns involving CBS.&rdquo; CBS also ended the show of Kimmel&rsquo;s fellow late-night host Stephen Colbert, a decision <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/709544/stephen-colberts-version-of-the-late-show-will-end-next-may">CBS called financial</a> that was nonetheless widely seen as a concession to Trump &mdash; and that was celebrated by Carr.</p><p>The pressure from Carr, Sinclair, and Nexstar quickly reached ABC, which made a terse announcement it had pulled Kimmel&rsquo;s show off the air. Outlets with inside sources have indicated this wasn&rsquo;t because of public outrage or because Kimmel&rsquo;s bosses found the remarks inappropriate &mdash; <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-news/jimmy-kimmel-out-abc-charlie-kirk-comments-1235430078/"><em>Rolling Stone</em> reports</a> that &ldquo;multiple execs felt that Kimmel had not actually said anything over the line.&rdquo; Instead, they were &ldquo;pissing themselves&rdquo; over the threat of Trump administration retaliation, one source said.</p><p>Disney, too, has pressure points beyond broadcast license fines. The FCC chair has previously threatened to investigate it for having (non-&ldquo;ideological,&rdquo; of course) diversity programs. And as <a href="https://www.status.news/p/jimmy-kimmel-pulled-fcc-decision">Oliver Darcy of <em>Status</em> notes</a>, the company is &ldquo;working to complete a high-stakes deal with the NFL, one that is crucial to the future of ESPN&rdquo; and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/espn-nfl-deal-faces-regulatory-hurdles-2025-08-07/">requires regulatory approval</a> from the Department of Justice. Trump <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/attorney-general-pam-bondi-doj-hate-speech-rcna231633">incidentally told</a> an ABC journalist this week that the DOJ might &ldquo;come after ABC&rdquo; for &ldquo;hate&rdquo; offenses, responding to questions about a &ldquo;hate speech&rdquo; crackdown declared by Attorney General Pam Bondi after Kirk&rsquo;s death.</p><p>Under the First Amendment, a government official like Carr is allowed to call Kimmel talentless or unfunny. He&rsquo;s allowed to say Kimmel shouldn&rsquo;t be on the air. He&rsquo;s <em>not </em>allowed to accompany this with a clear threat backed by government authority. &ldquo;The easy way or the hard way&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t healthy debate, it&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/20/24346317/trump-gangster-tech-regulation-corruption-grift">gangster talk</a>. Or more precisely, government jawboning.</p><p>Even the substantially Trump-picked, overwhelmingly conservative Supreme Court has condemned something very similar to Carr&rsquo;s conduct. <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2025/09/17/cowardly-disney-caves-to-brendan-carrs-bogus-censorial-threats-pulling-jimmy-kimmel/">Mike Masnick at <em>Techdirt</em> points out</a> that a ruling last year, in the case <em>NRA v. Vullo</em>, declared flatly that &ldquo;the First Amendment prohibits government officials from relying on the &lsquo;threat of invoking legal sanctions and other means of coercion . . . to achieve the suppression&rsquo; of disfavored speech.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s true even if they do so through intermediaries like Nexstar rather than attacking the speaker directly.</p><p>Disney, of course, didn&rsquo;t have to bow to a clearly unconstitutional threat. CEO Bob Iger and Disney Entertainment chief Dana Walden, according to <em>Status</em>, were among the latest powerful figures who made a cowardly decision to appease Carr and Trump rather than stand up for themselves and their employees in public and, if necessary, in court.</p><p>But even if there&rsquo;s plenty of blame to go around, Carr&rsquo;s threat is impossible to ignore &mdash; and the implicit comparisons to conservative provocateurs being banned on social media, or commentators being fired after outcry for a hateful statement, or any other example of alleged &ldquo;cancel culture,&rdquo; off-base.

Perhaps smart glasses should be added to that list, if yesterday's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D97ILdUbYww">Meta Connect 2025 livestream</a> is anything to go by&mdash;as the new <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7706533-17145766?sid=pcg-gb-7075805990102387384&amp;url=https://www.ray-ban.com/usa/discover-ray-ban-meta-ai-glasses/clp">Ray-Ban Meta glasses</a> took the opportunity to misbehave at almost every turn.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/D97ILdUbYww?feature=shared&amp;t=2084">Unveiled to great fanfare</a> and a rapt audience by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, the second-generation smart glasses were promised to be capable of "empowering people with new abilities" and said to allow users to "make themselves smarter" thanks to the newly-polished AI functionality. Cool stuff, but when it came to the demos, things didn't exactly go to plan.</p><p>Switching over to a livestreamed demonstration, displayed to the audience on a gigantic panel at Zuckerberg's side,<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@CHEFCUSO"> chef Jack Mancuso</a> attempted to use the Live AI functionality of the smart specs to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/D97ILdUbYww?feature=shared&amp;t=2427">help them make a Korean-inspired steak sauce</a>. Standing in front of multiple unprepared ingredients (which the glasses initially appeared to recognise) the Meta specs immediately ignored a prompt to help make the sauce, instead listing the ingredients that might go in it.</p><p>Interrupting, Mancuso asked the AI a reasonable question: "What do I do first?" After a long silence, in which metaphorical pins could be heard dropping in the audience, Mancuso asked again. The AI then merrily informed our now visibly-nervous host that the base of the sauce was already made.</p><p>Another long pause. "What do I do first?" Mancuso asked once more, to laughter from the audience. "You've already combined the base ingredients," the AI continued, helpfully telling Mancuso to grate a pear into the non-existent sauce. "Alright, I think the Wi-Fi might be messed up" said Mancuso, looking embarrassed. "Back to you Mark."</p><figure><figcaption><span>(Image credit: Meta Developers)</span></figcaption></figure><p>"It's all good, it's all good" said Zuckerberg, amid cheers, laughter, and applause from the crowd. "The irony of all this whole thing is that you spend years making technology and then the Wi-Fi on the day kinda... catches you. We'll go check out what he made later."</p><p>Still, more demos were yet to come. Later in the presentation, Zuckerberg donned a pair of Ray-Ban Meta glasses himself, along with a wristband interface said to be able to control the glasses through muscle movements.</p><div><section><p>Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.</p></section></div><p>"Now, I want to get into this in more detail, we've got two options," said Zuckerberg, laughing nervously. "We've got the slides, or we've got the live demo." At this point, the audience erupted into shouts for the live version, unsurprisingly, along with more laughter.</p><p>Guess how it went. Zuckerberg was able to respond to a video call request with text via hand movements, which is fairly impressive, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/D97ILdUbYww?feature=shared&amp;t=3228">but was unable to answer the call itself</a>.</p><figure><figcaption><span>(Image credit: Meta Developers)</span></figcaption></figure><p>"Uh-oh," said the Meta CEO, frantically rubbing his fingers together in an attempt to pick up the line. "Well, I&hellip; let's see what happened there. That's too bad. I don't know what happened. Maybe Boz can try calling me again."</p><p>Nope. Despite multiple attempts, Zuckerberg was left standing on stage twiddling his fingers, as the Meta AI voice digitally crunched to tell him yet another call was incoming that he seemed unable to answer. At one point, Zuckerberg blamed himself for the inability to control the device, but the ringtone continued to play across a deathly-silent hall, despite his best efforts.</p><p>Eventually, the Meta head honcho gave up. "I don't know what to tell you guys," he said, eventually resorting to bringing the now much-awaited Boz onstage, amid a seemingly ever-present ringtone and much tittering from the crowd.</p><figure><div></div><figcaption><span>(Image credit: Meta Developers)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I'll be honest, it's a pretty painful watch. As tempting as it is to make fun of <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/profiles/mark-e-zuckerberg/">Meta's multi-billionaire CEO</a> for the borked demo, those of us who have had to present live ourselves will have our head in our hands, as I have while writing this article. It seems the Ray-Ban Meta glasses could do with <em>some work,</em> and while the tech looks very impressive on paper, the demo appears to have revealed some serious flaws in the implementation.</p><p>I can't imagine many will be rushing to order a pair after this particular demonstration, but I can't help but think of another old showbiz clich&eacute;: There's no such thing as bad PR. We're all talking about it at least, and that's the main thing, eh Zuck?<em> </em></p></div><div><p>Andy built his first gaming PC at the tender age of 12, when IDE cables were a thing and high resolution wasn't&mdash;and he hasn't stopped since.

This is how a four-year-old mourns a goldfish.&rdquo;</p><p>The quips drew outrage on the right. FCC Chair Brendan Carr accused Kimmel of lying to the American public and suggested the commission could take regulatory action against ABC. &ldquo;We can do this the easy way or the hard way,&rdquo; Carr said on a podcast hosted by far-right commentator Benny Johnson, in remarks that carried unmistakable menace. Hours later, Disney chief executive Robert Iger and television chief Dana Walden decided to pull Kimmel&rsquo;s show indefinitely, the <em><em>New York Times</em></em> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/17/business/media/abc-jimmy-kimmel.html">reports</a>.</p><p><strong>Related: </strong><a href="https://www.advocate.com/news/charlie-kirk-dead-utah-shooting">Right-wing firebrand Charlie Kirk dead after shooting at university in Utah</a></p><p>The sequence of events amounts to a chilling exertion of political pressure on a major broadcast network &mdash; a move critics say undermines the very notion of a free press and the First Amendment.

Nexstar Media Group, which is pursuing a $6.2 billion merger under FCC review, announced it would pre-empt Kimmel &ldquo;for the foreseeable future.&rdquo; Sinclair Broadcast Group, which espouses conservative values, soon followed, demanding an apology to Kirk&rsquo;s family and a donation to Turning Point USA.

It also seeks to ban all <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/best-vpn/">use of VPNs</a>, foreign or US-produced.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. </em><a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=cnet.com#link=%7B%22role%22:%22standard%22,%22href%22:%22https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=cnet.com%22,%22target%22:%22%22,%22absolute%22:%22%22,%22linkText%22:%22Add%20CNET%22%7D"><em>Add CNET</em></a><em> as a preferred Google source.</em></p><hr><p>VPNs, or virtual private networks, are privacy tools that can be used to keep browsing activities hidden and can be used as workarounds to avoid similar content bans that have passed in states like Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi and the UK.

Associated fines would be up to $500,000.</p><h2>What the ban could mean for VPNs</h2><figure> <figcaption> <span>Screenshot by CNET</span></figcaption></figure><p>Unlike some laws banning access to adult content, this Michigan bill is comprehensive. It applies to all residents of Michigan, adults or children, targets an extensive range of content and includes language that could ban not <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/best-vpn-for-streaming/">only VPNs</a> but any method of bypassing internet filters or restrictions.&nbsp;</p><p>That could spell trouble for <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/best-vpn-for-windows/">VPN owners</a> and other internet users who leverage these tools to improve their privacy, protect their identities online, prevent ISPs from gathering data about them or <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/best-antivirus/">increase their device safety</a> when browsing on public Wi-Fi.</p><p><strong>Read more</strong>: <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/vpn-survey-2025">CNET Survey: 47% of Americans Use VPNs for Privacy. That Number Could Rise. Here's Why</a></p><p>Bills like these could have unintended side effects. John Perrino, Senior Policy and Advocacy Expert for the nonprofit&nbsp;<a href="https://www.internetsociety.org">Internet Society</a>, mentioned to CNET that adult content laws like this could interfere with what kind of music people can stream, the sexual health forums and articles they can access and even important news involving sexual topics that they may want to read.</p><p>&nbsp;"Additionally, state age verification laws are difficult for smaller services to comply with, hurting competition and an open internet," Perrino said.</p><p>The Anticorruption of Public Morals Act has not passed the Michigan House of Representatives committee or been voted on by the Michigan Senate, and it's not clear how much support the bill has beyond the six Republican representatives who have proposed it. As we've seen with state legislation in the past, sometimes bills like these can serve as templates for other representatives who may want to propose similar laws in their own states.</p><h2>Could VPNs still get around bans like these?</h2><figure><div><picture><source srcset="https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/41689d3f88079acf6ad3a417e082f29964f9d62c/hub/2025/08/22/6281cb39-862d-4a0d-99fd-e226c2cc9ee4/pia-vpn-review-multi-hop.png?auto=webp&amp;width=768" alt="PIA VPN multi-hop and obfuscation servers"><source srcset="https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/459e6591c269b78c9212ae6fb03b8fc2b8d210f3/hub/2025/08/22/6281cb39-862d-4a0d-99fd-e226c2cc9ee4/pia-vpn-review-multi-hop.png?auto=webp&amp;width=1024" alt="PIA VPN multi-hop and obfuscation servers"><source srcset="https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/602336d83849d66df682b32feaf4177cad136f83/hub/2025/08/22/6281cb39-862d-4a0d-99fd-e226c2cc9ee4/pia-vpn-review-multi-hop.png?auto=webp&amp;width=1200" alt="PIA VPN multi-hop and obfuscation servers"> <img src="https://www.cnet.com" alt="PIA VPN multi-hop and obfuscation servers" height="826.3229308005427" width="1200"></source></source></source></picture></div><figcaption> <span>Screenshot by CNET</span></figcaption></figure><p>Could VPNs still get around this type of ban? That's a complex question that this bill doesn't really address.&nbsp;</p><p>"From a technical standpoint, ISPs can attempt to distinguish VPN traffic using deep packet inspection, or they can block known VPN IP addresses," said <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/nordvpn-review/">NordVPN privacy advocate Laura Tyrylyte</a>. "However, deploying them effectively requires big investments and ongoing maintenance, making large-scale VPN blocking both costly and complex."</p><p>Also, VPNs have ways around deep packet inspection and other methods.&nbsp;</p><p>"Some VPNs offer&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/vpn-obfuscation-what-it-is-and-why-you-might-need-it/">obfuscation</a>&nbsp;-- which tries to disguise VPN traffic as standard web traffic -- using dedicated servers or custom VPN protocols, like <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/nordvpn-review/">NordVPN's</a> NordWhisper or Proton VPN's Stealth," said CNET senior editor Moe Long. "But note that obfuscation isn't foolproof."</p><p>There are also no-log claims offered by many VPNs, asserting that VPN companies don't keep a record of your activity. <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/nordvpn-backs-up-its-no-log-claims-with-a-new-audit-from-deloitte">No-log audits from third parties like Deloitte</a> are important trust signals, even if they don't fully guarantee that your data is completely safe. VPNs can even use server tricks, such as RAM-only servers that automatically erase all data when turned off or rebooted.</p><p>If you're seriously concerned about your data privacy, you can look for features like these in a VPN and see if they are right for you.

That, in turn, prompted one group of ABC affiliates, owned by Nexstar Media Group, to declare they will not air <em>Jimmy Kimmel Live!</em> for the immediate future, which then led ABC to announce the show was being taken off the air &ldquo;indefinitely.&rdquo; </p><p>The uproar started after Kimmel said a comment that many took as suggesting suspected Kirk assassin Tyler Robinson was a MAGA Republican. &ldquo;We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it,&rdquo; Kimmel said. </p><p>Carr was interviewed by <a href="https://x.com/bennyjohnson/status/1968359685045838041">YouTuber</a> <a href="https://x.com/bennyjohnson/status/1968359685045838041">Benny Johnson</a> on Wednesday (video also below), where he appeared to threaten ABC affiliate licenses over the comments, which he called &ldquo;the sickest conduct possible.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;[This] appears to be an action by Jimmy Kimmel to play into the narrative that this was somehow a MAGA or Republican-motivated person,&rdquo; Carr said. &ldquo;What people don&rsquo;t understand is that the broadcasters &hellip; have a license granted by us at the FCC, and that comes with it an obligation to operate in the public interest. When we see stuff like this, look, we can do this the easy way or the hard way. These companies can find ways to change conduct, on Kimmel, or there&rsquo;s going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.&rdquo; </p><p>Johnson said he&rsquo;d like to see an apology from Kimmel to Kirk and his family and asked Carr what other punitive steps the FCC might take. </p><p>&ldquo;I think what you said strikes me as a very reasonable, minimal step that can be taken,&rdquo; Carr said. &ldquo;Calls for Kimmel to be fired &mdash; I think, you could certainly see a path forward for a suspension over this. You know, the FCC is going to have remedies.&rdquo;</p><p>Carr then ran down some of the media earthquakes that have transpired under the second Trump administration, from Stephen Colbert&rsquo;s <em>The Late Show</em> being canceled next year, to NPR and PBS being defunded, to CBS News taking steps to be more &ldquo;fact based.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So I think you see some lashing out from people like Kimmel, who are frankly talentless and are looking for ways to get attention,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Their grip on the narrative is slipping. That doesn&rsquo;t mean that it&rsquo;s not still important to hold the public interest standard &hellip; We have a rule on the book that interprets the public interest standard that says &lsquo;news distortion&rsquo; is something that is prohibited &hellip; the FCC has stepped back from enforcing it &hellip; I think it&rsquo;s past time these [affiliates] themselves push back on Comcast and this and say, &lsquo;Listen, we&rsquo;re not going to run Kimmel anymore until you straighten this out because we&rsquo;re running the possibility of license revocation from the FCC if we continue to run content that ends up being a pattern of news distortion.&rsquo; So I think again, Disney needs to see some change here.&rdquo; (Note: Comcast owns NBC Universal; Disney owns ABC.) </p><p>Nexstar then issued the following statement in response to Carr&rsquo;s comments: &ldquo;Nexstar&rsquo;s owned and partner television stations affiliated with the ABC Television Network will preempt <em>Jimmy Kimmel Live!</em> for the foreseeable future beginning with tonight&rsquo;s show. Nexstar strongly objects to recent comments made by Mr. Kimmel concerning the killing of Charlie Kirk and will replace the show with other programming in its ABC-affiliated markets.&rdquo; Nexstar currently operates 28 ABC affiliates across the country, mostly in small or midsize markets, though they include the ABC stations in New Orleans and Salt Lake City.</p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Kimmel&rsquo;s comments about the death of Mr. Kirk are o&#64256;ensive and insensitive at a critical time in our national political discourse, and we do not believe they reflect the spectrum of opinions, views, or values of the local communities in which we are located,&rdquo; added Andrew Alford, President of Nexstar&rsquo;s broadcasting division. &ldquo;Continuing to give Mr. Kimmel a broadcast platform in the communities we serve is simply not in the public interest at the current time, and we have made the di&#64259;cult decision to preempt his show in an e&#64256;ort to let cooler heads prevail as we move toward the resumption of respectful, constructive dialogue.&rdquo;</p><div><p>The affiliate group pulling Kimmel was quickly followed by ABC announcing the show had been suspended. A network spokesperson said&nbsp;<em>Jimmy Kimmel Live!</em>&nbsp;will be &ldquo;pre-empted indefinitely.&rdquo;</p><p>Yet Carr&rsquo;s tactics drew fire from within the department itself as FCC Commissioner Anna Gomez responded on social media by criticizing the Chair&rsquo;s threats.</p></div><p>&ldquo;An inexcusable act of political violence by one disturbed individual must never be exploited as justification for broader censorship or control,&rdquo; <a href="https://x.com/AGomezFCC/status/1968406707484144057">Gomez wrote</a>. &ldquo;This Administration is increasingly using the weight of government power to suppress lawful expression, not because it glorifies violence or breaks the law, but because it challenges those in power or reflects views they oppose.&nbsp;We must stand firm against every attempt to silence dissent, punish satirists and government critics, and erode individual liberty. To surrender our right to speak freely is to accept that those in power, not the people, will set the boundaries of debate that define a free society.&rdquo; </p><figure></figure> <figure><p><iframe title="Jimmy Kimmel LIES About Charlie Kirk Killer, Blames Charlie For His Murder!?

"To prevent future radicalization and violence, the CEOs of Discord, Steam, Twitch, and Reddit must appear before the Oversight Committee and explain what actions they will take to ensure their platforms are not exploited for nefarious purposes."</p><p>Letters from the House Oversight Committee have been sent to Humam Sakhnini, CEO of Discord; Gabe Newell, president of Steam maker Valve; Dan Clancy, CEO of Twitch; and Steve Huffman, CEO of Reddit, requesting their testimony on Oct. 8. "The hearing will examine radicalization of online forum users, including incidents of open incitement to commit violent politically motivated acts," Comer said in a letter to each CEO.</p><p>The catalyst for Comer's request is the killing of Charlie Kirk, the right-wing political activist and media personality who was shot at Utah Valley University last week. The suspect in that case, Tyler Robinson, is <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2025/09/15/charlie-kirk-shooter-suspect-discord-chat/">reported to have used Discord</a> to discuss the killing after the fact, and is alleged to have been <a href="https://www.polygon.com/charlie-kirk-shooter-helldivers-2-meme-tyler-robinson/">steeped in online meme culture</a>.</p><p>Steam and Discord have long been homes for extremists to gather, coordinate, and harass their perceived enemies, despite both platforms being aimed at gamers and designed originally for non-political purposes. The 2017 white supremacist rally Unite the Right in Charlottesville, Virginia was planned through Discord, and the platform was used by far-right mass shooters in the 2022 Buffalo shooting and the Highland Park Parade shooting. In 2024, the <a href="https://www.adl.org/resources/report/steam-powered-hate-top-gaming-site-rife-extremism-antisemitism">Anti-Defamation League</a> reported that Steam was "rife with extremism and antisemitism" across Steam Community groups.

In 2024, ProPublica reported that Honey had played a key role in Mitchell’s behind-the-scenes effort to change Georgia’s election rules to allow Republican officials to contest a potential Trump loss in that year’s presidential race. Honey also promoted election conspiracy theories, including one Trump cited in a speech to his followers before they stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.</p><p>Though states do the on-the-ground work of running elections, DHS supports them with tasks beyond their capacities, such as protecting IT infrastructure and voter databases from foreign intrusions. The agency, with bipartisan support, took on this role in the aftermath of Russia’s interference in the 2016 election.</p><p>Experts on voting and state election officials warned that Honey’s appointment as DHS’ deputy assistant secretary of election integrity could erode trust between state and federal officials, prompting states not to share information with the agency.</p><p>“We are witnessing a dangerous trend: the elevation of known bad-faith actors like Heather Honey,” said Adrian Fontes, Arizona’s Democratic secretary of state, in a statement, citing Honey’s “well-documented history of spreading election lies that have been debunked in court.”</p><p>Fontes called her involvement with DHS “deeply troubling” and said “when the agency gives a platform to individuals who have actively worked to erode public trust, it becomes harder to view DHS as a reliable partner in election security.”</p><p>A DHS spokesperson did not answer questions from ProPublica on Honey’s appointment or the exact nature of her responsibilities. Honey didn’t respond to calls or emails. The White House also didn’t respond to a request for comment. Her name is listed on the organization’s leadership structure online, and her appointment was first reported by the website Democracy Docket.</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1njcwto/she_pushed_to_overturn_the_loss_in_the_2020/nep852u/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not who votes that counts.
