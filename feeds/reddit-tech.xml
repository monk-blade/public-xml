He had a solid r&eacute;sum&eacute;, he thought: a paid internship at a civic-consulting firm, years of volunteering at environmental-defense organizations, experience working on farms and in parks as well as in offices, a close-to-perfect GPA, strong letters of recommendation. He would move anywhere on the West Coast, living out of his car if he had to. He would accept a temporary, part-time, or seasonal gig, not just a full-time position. He would do anything&mdash;filing paperwork, digging trenches&mdash;to build his dream career protecting California&rsquo;s wildlife and public lands.</p><p>He applied to 200 jobs. He got rejected 200 times. Actually, he clarified, he &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t get <em>rejected</em> 200 times.&rdquo; A lot of businesses never responded.</p><p>Right now, millions of would-be workers find themselves in a similar position. Corporate profits <a href="https://www.bea.gov/data/income-saving/corporate-profits">are strong</a>, the jobless rate is 4.3 percent, and wages are <a href="https://www.atlantafed.org/chcs/wage-growth-tracker">climbing in turn</a>. But payrolls have been essentially frozen for the past four months. The hiring rate has declined to <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/JTSHIR">its lowest point</a> since the jobless recovery following the Great Recession. Four years ago, employers were adding four or five workers for every 100 they had on the books, month in and month out. Now they are adding three.</p><p>At the same time, the process of getting a job has become a late-capitalist nightmare. Online hiring platforms have made it easier to find an opening but harder to secure one: Applicants send out thousands of AI-crafted r&eacute;sum&eacute;s, and businesses use AI to sift through them. What Bumble and Hinge did to the dating market, contemporary human-resources practices have done to the job market. People are swiping like crazy and getting nothing back.</p><p>Every time Harris logged in to LinkedIn or Indeed, he would see scores of gigs that seemed like they might be a good fit. He would read a posting carefully, scrub his r&eacute;sum&eacute;, tailor an introductory note, answer the company&rsquo;s screening questions, hit &ldquo;Send,&rdquo; hope for the best, and hear nothing in response&mdash;again and again and again.</p><p>Other job seekers described similar experiences. In suburban Virginia, a paralegal named Martine got laid off by a government contractor in April. (Like Harris, she did not want to dim her employment prospects by providing her full name.) She saw plenty of jobs being advertised at nonprofits, law firms, consultancies, and universities. She sent out dozens of applications. She even got to the second round a few times. But she never came close to being hired. &ldquo;I have 10 years of experience,&rdquo; she told me. &ldquo;I would be happy if a person told me no at this point.&rdquo;</p><p>For employers, the job market is working differently too. Businesses receive countless ill-fitting applications, along with a few good ones, for each open position. Rather than poring over the submissions by hand, they use machines. In a recent survey, chief HR officers told the Boston Consulting Group that they are <a href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/2025/ai-changing-recruitment">using AI</a> to write job descriptions, assess candidates, schedule introductory meetings, and evaluate applications. In some cases, firms are using chatbots to interview candidates, too. Prospective hires log in to a Zoom-like system and field questions from an avatar. Their performance is taped, and an algorithm searches for keywords and evaluates their tone.</p><p>Priya Rathod, a career-trends expert at Indeed, told me she understands why job seekers feel as if their r&eacute;sum&eacute;s are &ldquo;going into a void.&rdquo; But she argued that the online platforms make it easier for people to find open positions and that AI can &ldquo;get them to the next stage of the interview quicker,&rdquo; if their applications fit an employer&rsquo;s needs.</p><p>Still, a lot of job applicants never end up in a human-to-human process. The impossibility of getting to the interview stage spurs jobless workers to submit more applications, which pushes them to rely on ChatGPT to build their r&eacute;sum&eacute;s and respond to screening prompts. (Harris told me he does this; he used ChatGPT pretty much every day in college, and finds its writing to be more &ldquo;professional&rdquo; than his own.) And so the cycle continues: The surge in same-same AI-authored applications prompts employers to use robot filters to manage the flow. Everyone ends up in Tinderized job-search hell.</p><p>For months, the economy has been in a low-hire, low-fire equilibrium; virtually every sector of the labor market except for health care has been frozen. The amount of time a worker has spent looking for a job has climbed to an average of <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LNU03008276">10 weeks</a>, meaning that Americans are spending two weeks longer on the job market than they were a few years ago. The share of American workers quitting a job has fallen to its lowest <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/JTSQUR">level in a decade</a>, because of concerns about rising prices and jitters about slowing growth.</p><p>The equilibrium now seems to be falling apart, and a full-on recession looks likely. Black workers have experienced a dramatic <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LNS14000006">surge in joblessness</a>, in part because of the Trump administration&rsquo;s mass layoffs of federal employees. (The 154,000 civil servants who took the White House&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/02/doge-musk-federal-agencies-takeover/681744/">&ldquo;</a><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/02/doge-musk-federal-agencies-takeover/681744/">Fork in the Road</a><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/02/doge-musk-federal-agencies-takeover/681744/">&rdquo;</a> deferred-resignation offer will receive their last <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/07/31/federal-workers-doge-buyout-paid/">paycheck this month</a>.) More than 10 percent of workers under the age of 24 are searching for <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LNS14024887">a job</a>. &ldquo;Performance-based and strategic layoffs are increasing,&rdquo; Lydia Boussour of the consultancy EY-Parthenon wrote in a note to clients last week. &ldquo;Cracks are increasingly showing.&rdquo;</p><p>What is a worker supposed to do? Martine and Harris and millions like them are still trying to figure that out; she keeps on applying, whereas he is doing landscaping and volunteering. Rathod said that she recommends old-fashioned networking: asking recruiters out for coffee, going to in-person job events, and surveying friends and former employers for leads.</p><p>Such strategies might work if employers begin hiring again. But if not, millions more people might be left pitching their CVs into the void.</p></section><div class="gallery"><p><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/G3J3fAQrlILC_OcsAGs76IWlZmo=/438x0:1563x1125/80x80/media/img/mt/2025/09/2025_6_7_Impossible_To_Get_A_Job/original.jpg"></p></div></section>]]></description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Sep 2025 21:25:03 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3324637/top-harvard-mathematician-liu-jun-leaves-us-china</link><title>Top Harvard mathematician Liu Jun leaves US for China (scmp.com)</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1nb87bl/top_harvard_mathematician_liu_jun_leaves_us_for/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1nb87bl/top_harvard_mathematician_liu_jun_leaves_us_for/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p>Reading time: 2 min | <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1nb87bl/top_harvard_mathematician_liu_jun_leaves_us_for/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='preview-image'><img src='https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_image_scmp_generic/public/d8/images/canvas/2025/09/07/45fcea36-18e9-4c9b-84ca-2f6143efce05_5ad33423.jpg?itok=9gU6RQL7&v=1757218100' /></section><section class='parsed-content'><section><p>Liu Jun, one of the world&rsquo;s leading statisticians and a long-time professor at Harvard, has returned to China full-time, accepting a prestigious chair at Tsinghua University last month.</p><p>The move marks the <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3309548/wanted-china-born-researchers-leave-us-work-china-attractive-pay?module=inline&amp;pgtype=article" title><span>homecoming of an academic</span></a> whose career has spanned research in data science, biostatistics and <a href="https://www.scmp.com/topics/artificial-intelligence?module=inline&amp;pgtype=article" title><span>artificial intelligence</span></a> &ndash; and whose early life reflected the complex interplay between intellectual pursuit and political engagement.</p><p>In 1988, Liu Jun transferred from Rutgers University in New Jersey to the University of Chicago, studying under statistician Wing Hung Wong.</p><p>While there, he became deeply interested in human rights issues and spent a considerable amount of time <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/3201760/inspired-rare-protests-mainland-chinese-students-north-america-organise-and-speak-out?module=inline&amp;pgtype=article" title><span>taking part in student protests</span></a>.</p><p>The student movement he supported did not occur in Chicago, but in Beijing.</p><p>In 1989, students held a <a href="https://www.scmp.com/topics/tiananmen-square-crackdown?module=inline&amp;pgtype=article" title><span>massive demonstration in Tiananmen Square</span></a> and overseas student groups have organised events in support of the cause.

Dave W. Plummer, who helped develop the Windows Task Manager and ported Space Cadet Pinball to Windows, <a href="https://x.com/davepl1968/status/1963803025572770212">posted on X</a> saying that his two Amazon Echo Show devices, which he said he "never" uses, exceeded 4 GB of data usage in 24 hours.</p><p>According to the image Plummer shared, he has two Amazon Echo Show devices, which are smart speakers with a touchscreen interface designed to serve as a hub for smart homes. However, these devices are more than just digital switches; they also connect to the internet to send you notifications, install updates, and potentially sync with your cloud storage to display your pictures. With the screen, Echo Shows also update often to show traffic reports, news stories, and photos.</p><div><blockquote><p>I know it's a lot of folks' first assumption, but I highly doubt the Echo is always listening and uploading. That would be patently obvious to many people, and would have been detected long ago.Odds are it's (a) a bug, or (b) they both took big updates that day, or (c) it's&hellip;<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1964006765441450105">September 5, 2025</a></p></blockquote></div><p>Plummer doesn't seem to think that Alexa is always listening to him. In <a href="https://x.com/davepl1968/status/1964006765441450105">a follow-up post</a>, he wrote that "Odds are it's (a) a bug, or (b) they both took big updates that day, or (c) it's cached video content. The Echo Show does video, so for all I know, it's downloading trailers of movies. But it ain't spying, I'd put money on that."</p><p>One commenter on Plummer&rsquo;s post speculated that if the smart speaker hears the activation command, such as &ldquo;Hey, <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/google">Google</a>&rdquo; or &ldquo;Alexa,&rdquo; it will record an <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/audio">audio</a> clip of the environment and send it to its servers for processing. So, even if you didn&rsquo;t call the device, but hear something similar, it will still send information for analysis and recording, which will use up your data.</p><p>Other users also pointed to Amazon Sidewalk as the culprit. Sidewalk is a wide mesh network that allows Amazon devices to communicate with each other, even if they&rsquo;re on the edge of your network, by piggybacking on other Sidewalk-enabled devices. Amazon says that this is a low-bandwidth service and should have a 500 MB cap per account per month, but some commenters recommended turning it off to save on data.</p><p>As for the amount of data used by the Amazon Echo, it appears to average out, especially when running a firmware update and syncing files. The only way to know is to check the history of the devices, but if the risk (of both privacy and data usage) is not worth it for you, you can just unplug them to ensure they won&rsquo;t be listening at all.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB"><u><em>Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></u></a><em>, or </em><a href="https://google.com/preferences/source?q="><u><em>add us as a preferred source</em></u></a><em>, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

And Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) said he has &ldquo;grown deeply concerned&rdquo; about Kennedy&rsquo;s tenure.</p><p>&ldquo;I support vaccines. Vaccines save lives. If we&rsquo;re going to make America healthy again, we can&rsquo;t allow public health to be undermined,&rdquo; Barrasso said.</p><p>Kennedy <a href="https://www.nj.com/politics/2025/09/whos-the-most-popular-trump-official-polling-analyst-reveals-surprising-answer.html" title="https://www.nj.com/politics/2025/09/whos-the-most-popular-trump-official-polling-analyst-reveals-surprising-answer.html">defiantly defended</a> the mission of his department and his <a href="https://www.nj.com/politics/2025/08/exiting-officials-give-dire-warning-about-trump-czar-rfk-jr-millions-of-american-lives-at-risk.html" title="https://www.nj.com/politics/2025/08/exiting-officials-give-dire-warning-about-trump-czar-rfk-jr-millions-of-american-lives-at-risk.html">recent firing</a> of Dr. Susan Monarez, who served as the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for about a month.</p><p>&ldquo;We are the sickest country in the world. That&rsquo;s why we have to fire people at the CDC,&rdquo; Kennedy said during the hearing. &ldquo;They did not do their job. This was their job to keep us healthy. And I need to fire some of those people to make sure this doesn&rsquo;t happen again.&rdquo;</p><p>During later remarks, Trump stood by Kennedy, telling reporters, &ldquo;I like the fact that he&rsquo;s different.&rdquo; He acknowledged that he didn&rsquo;t watch the hearing, but had &ldquo;heard he did very well today.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He means very well, and he&rsquo;s got some little different ideas,&rdquo; Trump said. &ldquo;I guarantee a lot of the people at this table like RFK Jr., and I do, but he&rsquo;s got a different take, and we want to listen to all of those takes.&rdquo;</p><p>Monarez, in an <a href="https://www.wsj.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-the-cdc-and-me-b4ca2eaa?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAgeZZ-BwWgPjSlYDMFnarjgPM5xJlDAar0-ulLcExu_D2BlQtvCW-vWD2zMnWw%3D&amp;gaa_ts=68b9e896&amp;gaa_sig=TgF5x_CqnAJQTOIHgOn8369BRpzNEiu2ZWlq8TUW5ikHv9ZQWp7MVXzf-Nkum1k0LqY36_uVtKaqv23wkcipaw%3D%3D" title="https://www.wsj.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-the-cdc-and-me-b4ca2eaa?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAgeZZ-BwWgPjSlYDMFnarjgPM5xJlDAar0-ulLcExu_D2BlQtvCW-vWD2zMnWw%3D&amp;gaa_ts=68b9e896&amp;gaa_sig=TgF5x_CqnAJQTOIHgOn8369BRpzNEiu2ZWlq8TUW5ikHv9ZQWp7MVXzf-Nkum1k0LqY36_uVtKaqv23wkcipaw%3D%3D">opinion piece</a> for The Wall Street Journal published Thursday, said that she had lost her job after 29 days, but &ldquo;America&rsquo;s children could lose far more.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The CDC can&rsquo;t fulfill its obligation to the American people if its leader can&rsquo;t demand proof in decision-making.

The camera zooms too close to the president&rsquo;s face; the table at which the <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/big-tech">tech executives</a> are seated seems far too long. <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/mark-zuckerberg-secretive-hawaii-compound-burial-ground/">Mark Zuckerberg</a> is there, and Bill Gates and Tim Cook and Satya Nadella and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/researchers-leave-meta-superintelligence-labs-openai/">Sam Altman</a> and on and on, a baker&rsquo;s dozen or so of Silicon Valley&rsquo;s most powerful people&mdash;cutthroat competitors all&mdash;united here to pledge allegiance to Donald Trump.</p><p>The introduction from Trump is characteristically both overgilded and confusing: &ldquo;It's an honor to be here with this group of people. They're leading a revolution in business and in genius and every other word.&rdquo; And then, about 90 seconds in, the pandering begins.</p><p>This was Donald Trump&rsquo;s dinner with tech leaders at the State Dining Room in the White House on Thursday evening, broadcast in part for all to see <a href="https://www.c-span.org/program/white-house-event/president-trump-hosts-tech-leaders-for-white-house-dinner/665202">on C-SPAN</a>. It&rsquo;s in many ways a remarkable document, the culmination of months of <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/tech-ceos-trump-claims-are-courting-him/">Big Tech cozying up</a> to the administration.</p><p>One by one, Trump asked the executives how much they were investing in the United States. One by one, they obliged, praising Trump&rsquo;s leadership along the way. The president has run this play previously with his cabinet members, powerful people tripping over themselves in the race toward Trump&rsquo;s good graces. But there was an eeriness to seeing that same dynamic among Big Tech&rsquo;s braintrust, like passing a camera around to take turns wishing a distant, unloved uncle a very happy Thanksgiving.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be something like $600 billion through &rsquo;28,&rdquo; said <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/mark-zuckerberg-meta-offer-top-ai-talent-300-million/">Zuckerberg</a> about Meta&rsquo;s domestic infrastructure investments. Sergey Brin congratulated Trump on &ldquo;applying pressure&rdquo; in Venezuela, two days after a US drone operator <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/us-military-kills-11-people-strike-alleged-drug-boat-venezuela-trump-says-2025-09-03/">extrajudicially murdered</a> 11 people on an alleged drug cartel boat.</p><p>Everyone else praised the administration&rsquo;s AI policy. <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/microsofts-satya-nadella-is-betting-everything-on-ai/">Microsoft&rsquo;s Nadella</a> shouted out Melania Trump in particular for her leadership in &ldquo;skilling and economic opportunity that comes with AI.&rdquo; (The first lady launched a Presidential Artificial Intelligence Challenge last month and hosted an education-themed AI task force meeting prior to the dinner on Thursday.) <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/sundar-pichai-google-ai-microsoft-openai/">Google CEO Sundar Pichai</a> and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/lisa-su-runs-amd-and-is-out-for-nvidias-blood/">AMD CEO Lisa Su</a> praised the Trump administration&rsquo;s AI initiatives.</p><p>&ldquo;I want to thank you for setting the tone such that we could make a major investment in the United States,&rdquo; said Cook, referring to Apple&rsquo;s pledge to put $600 billion into US manufacturing. Given that Apple made that commitment under <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/us-tariffs-could-make-smartphones-dumber/">threat of crippling tariffs on smartphones</a>, it was a bit like thanking the school bully for setting the tone such that you can give him your lunch money.</p><p>For enthusiasm it was hard to beat Oracle CEO Safra Catz, who had previously served as a member of Trump&rsquo;s transition team. &ldquo;You've unleashed American innovation and creativity. All the work you're doing in basically every cabinet post in addition to what's coming out of the White House is making it possible for America to win,&rdquo; Catz said. &ldquo;I think this is the most exciting time in America ever.&rdquo; And with that, after a quick joke about his rumored demise, Trump opened up the floor to questions from the media. If you watch closely, you can catch Zuckerberg giving someone across the table an eyebrow raise for the ages.</p></div><div><p>Trump loves a banquet, which presumably means he loves a seating chart. Zuckerberg sat directly to Trump&rsquo;s right, while Gates scored a chair next to Melania Trump on the left. Sergey Brin and his &ldquo;really wonderful MAGA girlfriend&rdquo;&mdash;Trump&rsquo;s words&mdash;Gerelyn Gilbert-Soto sat directly across from the president. (Gilbert-Soto comes by that praise honestly; in addition to being an ardent supporter of Trump online, she has <a href="https://x.com/Omggerelyn/status/1963326746322927926">posted</a> on X that &ldquo;this world is a spiritual battlefield built on pagan roots, you can&rsquo;t escape it,&rdquo; specifically calling out Burning Man, Halloween, Christmas, and the US government as evil. This was on Wednesday.)</p><p>Emily Post fans will have already read into the significance of who sat where. &ldquo;The host or hostess of an official luncheon or dinner seats the guests according to rank,&rdquo; according to the etiquette <a href="https://emilypost.com/advice/seating-at-an-official-luncheon-or-dinner">guide</a>. &ldquo;Guests who have no protocol ranking are seated according to the unspoken rank the host assigns to them.&rdquo; Pity Nadella, seated in the table&rsquo;s hinterlands.</p><p>(You may have noted the absence of <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-digital-coup-doge-data-ai/">Elon Musk</a>, <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/jeff-bezos/">Jeff Bezos</a>, and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/nvidia-hardware-is-eating-the-world-jensen-huang/">Nvidia&rsquo;s Jensen Huang</a>. It&rsquo;s unclear whether they weren&rsquo;t invited or had a scheduling conflict, but between <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/doge">DOGE</a>, The Washington Post&rsquo;s hard-right turn, and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/nvidia-chips-export-controls-trump-h20-security/">Nvidia&rsquo;s dealmaking</a>, it&rsquo;s safe to say they&rsquo;re already in Trump&rsquo;s good graces.)</p><p>There&rsquo;s also the matter of who got to speak and who didn&rsquo;t. <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/sam-altman-says-chatgpt-is-on-track-to-out-talk-humanity/">OpenAI CEO Sam Altman</a> did, while <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/researchers-leave-meta-superintelligence-labs-openai/">Meta Superintelligence Labs leader Alexandr Wang</a> did not. White House <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/crypto-industry-hails-david-sacks-czar/">AI and crypto czar David Sacks</a> got prime speaking placement, while his <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/musk-trump-feud-venture-capitalists-pick-sides/">podcast cohost Chamanth Palihapitiya</a> stared quietly at his stemware.</p><p>Even more telling than who didn&rsquo;t speak is what wasn&rsquo;t said. The topic of immigration, critically important to the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/uncanny-valley-podcast-why-silicon-valley-needs-immigration/">future of the US tech industry</a>&mdash;and surely of personal significance to the many immigrants seated at the table&mdash;went unmentioned. Other than Cook&rsquo;s rosy allusion, the potentially devastating <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/tariffs-are-going-to-make-your-electronics-more-expensive/">effect of tariffs on consumer tech prices</a> was off the table. And while it likely would have been too much to ask, particularly for this audience, the question of how exactly the US plans to power all of this AI innovation, and the accompanying, astronomical <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ai-carbon-emissions-energy-unknown-mystery-research/">environmental and consumer costs</a>, didn&rsquo;t even amount to an afterthought.</p><p>For years, a convenient shorthand for the average person&rsquo;s relationship with Big Tech has been that you&rsquo;re the product. That&rsquo;s still true. But as the most powerful executives in America continue to kowtow to a president who is systematically dismantling the foundations of democracy, it may be time for another axiom: The only principle is power.</p></div></div></section>]]></description><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2025 20:00:06 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.ft.com/content/31feb335-4945-475e-baaa-3b880d9cf8ce</link><title>Computer scientist Geoffrey Hinton: ‘AI will make a few people much richer and most people poorer’ (ft.com)</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1n94iku/computer_scientist_geoffrey_hinton_ai_will_make_a/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1n94iku/computer_scientist_geoffrey_hinton_ai_will_make_a/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p>Reading time: 2 min | <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1n94iku/computer_scientist_geoffrey_hinton_ai_will_make_a/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='separator separator-before-parsed-content'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='parsed-content'><div><div><div><p><span></span><span>Subscribe to unlock this article</span></p></div><div><h2><span><span>Try unlimited access</span></span></h2><h2><span><span>Only </span><span>Rs100</span><span> for 4 weeks</span></span></h2><p><span><span>Then </span><span>Rs4335</span><span> per month.
