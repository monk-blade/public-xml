(For an explanation of that, see our coverage of yesterday&#39;s part of the meeting here.)</p><p>But puzzlingly, they then voted to uphold access and coverage of MMRV vaccines for children under age 4 if they receive free vaccines through the federal Vaccines for Children program, which covers about half of American children, mostly low-income. The discrepancy projected the idea that the alleged safety concerns that led the panel to rescind the recommendation for MMRV generally, somehow did not apply to low-income, vulnerable children. The vote also created significant confusion for VFC coverage, which typically aligns with recommendations made by the panel.</p><p>Today, Kennedy&#39;s ACIP retook the vote, deciding 9-0 (with three abstentions) to align VFC coverage with their vote yesterday to strip the recommendation for MMRV in young children.</p></blockquote><p>What a fucking clown show. - day one they restrict MMRV.

Therefore, the VFC program will continue to cover MMRV vaccines for children under age 4. This is a split from standard policy that is likely to spur confusion, because VFC typically goes with ACIP recommendations. Also, Medicaid&#39;s Children&#39;s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) has to follow the ACIP vaccine recommendation and thus will no longer cover MMRV for children under age 4 covered by CHIP.</p></blockquote><p>That sounds at least somewhat encouraging? I mean, if you&#39;re running an insurance company and your goal is to spend as little money as possible on payouts, doesn&#39;t it make sense to cover vaccines that prevent children from getting debilitating diseases? Vaccines are cheap, hospital stays and prolonged treatment regimens are expensive. Why wouldn&#39;t the insurance companies continue to cover them when every group of medical professionals under the sun recommends them? Those companies know as well as anyone else that RFK&#39;s HHS isn&#39;t making evidence-based decisions here.</p><p>That CHIP exclusion is tragic, though. It truly is terrible that the country&#39;s poorest children will be the ones to suffer most from this. Kennedy and his anti-science goons are play acting at being medical professionals and gambling with lives in the process. It doesn&#39;t matter how republican your representative and your district may be, we should all be emailing and calling to demand that RFK Jr be removed because he and his band of clowns are putting lives at risk.</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1nkougv/in_new_level_of_stupid_rfk_jrs_antivaccine/nezlkim/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><div class="md"><p>The pro-life party is about to kill a lot of kids and stupid people who don’t believe in science.</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1nkougv/in_new_level_of_stupid_rfk_jrs_antivaccine/nezltng/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><div class="md"><p>Man lied under oath.

They were the first to cancel Kimmel. I&#39;m not sure if this is covered in the linked article OP posted (paywalled) but the FCC chairman recently made comments implying if Kimmel isn&#39;t cancelled, the merger will have problems. So yes, definitely government censorship mixed alongside the usual corporate corruption </p><p>See this article <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/what-is-nexstar-jimmy-kimmel-live-canceled.html">https://www.vulture.com/article/what-is-nexstar-jimmy-kimmel-live-canceled.html</a> </p><blockquote><p>What is Nexstar and who leads the company?</p><p>A company with a recent history of right-wing-campaign contributions, Nexstar currently owns 197 television stations across the U.S., more than competitors such as Sinclair, Scripps, and Hearst. A merger with Tribune Media in 2019 made Nexstar the largest TV-station owner in the country.(...)</p><p>And it wants to get even bigger: Founder and CEO Perry A. Sook has expressed an eagerness to make deals under the Trump administration. “We believe that there is value to be created for our shareholders through further consolidation,” he said on his earnings call immediately following the 2024 election. In August, Sook made his move, announcing Nexstar had a deal in place to acquire its competitor Tegna, another major TV-affiliate owner, for $6.2 billion pending regulatory approval(...).</p><p>Enter Kimmel, who, in his late-night comedy show’s monologue on Monday, said, “We had some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Kirk as anything other than one of them and with everything they can to score political points from it.” As my colleague Joe Adalian covered in his breakdown of Kimmel’s cancellation, this was enough to trigger a rebuke on Wednesday from FCC chairman Brendan Carr — the man leading the regulator that would review any merger Nexstar would make.</p><p>“We can do this the easy way or the hard way,” Carr told right-wing YouTuber Benny Johnson. “These companies can find ways to take action on Kimmel, or there is going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.” He also called out the power of the FCC to revoke broadcast licenses: “They have a license granted by us at the FCC, and that comes with it an obligation to operate in the public interest.”</p></blockquote></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1nkl8b0/yes_jimmy_kimmels_suspension_was_government/neyymp6/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><div class="md"><p>What about Stephen Colbert?

No one else is going to download the new app.</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1nkk855/tiktok_to_be_sold_to_trumps_right_wing/neyum5v/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><div class="md"><p>Some points from this piece:</p><blockquote><p>After endless delays, Trump insiders claim to be zeroing in on a deal that would sell 80% of TikTok’s U.S. assets to Andreessen Horowitz (owned by Marc Andreessen, an increasingly incoherent right wing billionaire and close Trump ally), Oracle (owned by Larry Ellison, a rabidly right wing billionaire and close Trump ally), and Silver Lake (a hedge fund with a history of… predatory and dodgy behaviors).</p><p>Andreessen and Ellison are, to be clear, technofascists who don’t believe in democracy, regulatory oversight, or basic privacy protections for consumers. The remaining 20 percent would remain in the hands of Chinese ownership and the Chinese government, which still has to finalize the deal. This is not, contrary to what you’ll read in the pages of WAPO or CNN, a net improvement.</p><p>Oh, and Donald Trump will get to appoint a board member. Remember when Republicans were against government interference in private businesses?</p><p>If you recall, selling TikTok to Trump’s buddies was always his goal (remember he originally wanted it split between Walmart and Oracle). It just got temporarily disrupted by his 2020 election loss.</p><p>Trump still didn’t truly get what he really wanted: reporting in the Financial Times suggests that China will still technically own and control the algorithm used to power TikTok, something Trump had previously said was essential to any deal. Early reporting by the Wall Street Journal also indicates that existing TikTok users will have to migrate to a new app.</p><p>...</p><p>I’ve noted more times than I can count that the push to ban TikTok was never really about protecting American privacy. If that were true, we would pass a real privacy law and craft serious penalties for companies and executives that play fast and loose with sensitive American data, be it TikTok or the myriad of super dodgy apps, telecoms, and hardware vendors monetizing your phone usage.</p><p>It was never really about propaganda. If that were true, we’d take aim at the extremely well funded authoritarian propaganda machine and engage in content moderation of race-baiting political propaganda that’s filling the brains of young American men with pudding and hate. We’d push for education media literacy reforms common in countries like Finland.</p><p>Banning TikTok was never really about national security. If that were true, we wouldn’t be dismantling our cybersecurity regulators, accidentally hosting sensitive military chats over Signal with journalists, voting to cement utterly incompetent knobs in unaccountable roles across military intelligence, and letting dodgy data brokers sell sensitive personal info to global governments (including our own).</p><p>TikTok’s Chinese ownership did pose some very real legitimate security, privacy, and NatSec concerns, but the MAGA folks “fixing” the problem were never competent or good faith actors, and the push to ban hijack TikTok was always about ego, money, and information control. </p><p>...</p><p>Larry Ellison in particular has been very keen to leverage his massive wealth gains during the Trump era(s) to buy every new and old media venture his family can get its hands on, from CBS and CNN (Time Warner), to TikTok. Trump’s FCC is busy stripping away whatever is left of media consolidation limits to accommodate this massive right wing power grab. And TikTok’s a very central piece of the puzzle.</p><p>American authoritarians are following the same playbook we’ve seen in countries like Hungary, where new and old media and journalism is either destroyed or hijacked in service to authoritarian leadership. It’s happening here, now, and the very least ethical people can do is recognize it and put up a fight.</p></blockquote><p>From this perspective it certainly seems that we are very much in a new gilded age with tech billionaires now looking to control an ever larger chunk of our lives. The technologies that have been created and pushed by these people and companies are accelerating this control, and so far the public seems to be going along with it. The parallels between what&#39;s happening now and what&#39;s happened in places like Hungary could be instructive, if people are willing to learn about them.</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1nkk855/tiktok_to_be_sold_to_trumps_right_wing/neyib7x/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><div class="md"><p>It already is a propaganda mill.</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1nkk855/tiktok_to_be_sold_to_trumps_right_wing/neynsl7/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p></li></ol></section>]]></description><pubDate>Fri, 19 Sep 2025 02:30:18 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.joe.ie/music/over-400-artists-remove-their-music-from-streaming-services-in-israel-854547</link><title>Over 400 artists to remove their music from streaming services in Israel (joe.ie)</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1nkiz2i/over_400_artists_to_remove_their_music_from/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1nkiz2i/over_400_artists_to_remove_their_music_from/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1nkiz2i/over_400_artists_to_remove_their_music_from/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='separator separator-before-comments'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='comments'><p>Top comments</p><ol><li><div class="md"><p>Over 400 artists and labels have blocked and removed their music from Israel in response to the genocide in Gaza.</p><p>Among them are Fontaines DC, Kneecap, and The Mary Wallopers.</p><p>The cultural boycott, titled No Music for Genocide, is an initiative asking artists and labels to pull their music from streaming platforms in Israel in response to the ongoing genocide.</p><p>In a statement, the coalition shared: “This tangible act is just one step toward honouring Palestinian demands to isolate and delegitimize Israel as it kills without consequence on the world stage.</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1nkiz2i/over_400_artists_to_remove_their_music_from/ney6ujl/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><div class="md"><p>Watching people scramble to pretend they don&#39;t understand the point of protest is disruption is always a laugh.</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1nkiz2i/over_400_artists_to_remove_their_music_from/nez7jmp/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><div class="md"><p>We all need to boycott all their products, food, cosmetics, tech , etc</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1nkiz2i/over_400_artists_to_remove_their_music_from/neyi72q/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><div class="md"><p>They removed their music from streaming services in China too right?
