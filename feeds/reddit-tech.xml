They were the first to cancel Kimmel. I&#39;m not sure if this is covered in the linked article OP posted (paywalled) but the FCC chairman recently made comments implying if Kimmel isn&#39;t cancelled, the merger will have problems. So yes, definitely government censorship mixed alongside the usual corporate corruption </p><p>See this article <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/what-is-nexstar-jimmy-kimmel-live-canceled.html">https://www.vulture.com/article/what-is-nexstar-jimmy-kimmel-live-canceled.html</a> </p><blockquote><p>What is Nexstar and who leads the company?</p><p>A company with a recent history of right-wing-campaign contributions, Nexstar currently owns 197 television stations across the U.S., more than competitors such as Sinclair, Scripps, and Hearst. A merger with Tribune Media in 2019 made Nexstar the largest TV-station owner in the country.(...)</p><p>And it wants to get even bigger: Founder and CEO Perry A. Sook has expressed an eagerness to make deals under the Trump administration. “We believe that there is value to be created for our shareholders through further consolidation,” he said on his earnings call immediately following the 2024 election. In August, Sook made his move, announcing Nexstar had a deal in place to acquire its competitor Tegna, another major TV-affiliate owner, for $6.2 billion pending regulatory approval(...).</p><p>Enter Kimmel, who, in his late-night comedy show’s monologue on Monday, said, “We had some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Kirk as anything other than one of them and with everything they can to score political points from it.” As my colleague Joe Adalian covered in his breakdown of Kimmel’s cancellation, this was enough to trigger a rebuke on Wednesday from FCC chairman Brendan Carr — the man leading the regulator that would review any merger Nexstar would make.</p><p>“We can do this the easy way or the hard way,” Carr told right-wing YouTuber Benny Johnson. “These companies can find ways to take action on Kimmel, or there is going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.” He also called out the power of the FCC to revoke broadcast licenses: “They have a license granted by us at the FCC, and that comes with it an obligation to operate in the public interest.”</p></blockquote></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1nkl8b0/yes_jimmy_kimmels_suspension_was_government/neyymp6/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><div class="md"><p>If the Trump administration hadn&#39;t stuck their nose in and this had just been about what Nextar and Sinclair did, I don&#39;t think those of us on the left would&#39;ve been quite as angry over this.

No one else is going to download the new app.</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1nkk855/tiktok_to_be_sold_to_trumps_right_wing/neyum5v/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><div class="md"><p>Some points from this piece:</p><blockquote><p>After endless delays, Trump insiders claim to be zeroing in on a deal that would sell 80% of TikTok’s U.S. assets to Andreessen Horowitz (owned by Marc Andreessen, an increasingly incoherent right wing billionaire and close Trump ally), Oracle (owned by Larry Ellison, a rabidly right wing billionaire and close Trump ally), and Silver Lake (a hedge fund with a history of… predatory and dodgy behaviors).</p><p>Andreessen and Ellison are, to be clear, technofascists who don’t believe in democracy, regulatory oversight, or basic privacy protections for consumers. The remaining 20 percent would remain in the hands of Chinese ownership and the Chinese government, which still has to finalize the deal. This is not, contrary to what you’ll read in the pages of WAPO or CNN, a net improvement.</p><p>Oh, and Donald Trump will get to appoint a board member. Remember when Republicans were against government interference in private businesses?</p><p>If you recall, selling TikTok to Trump’s buddies was always his goal (remember he originally wanted it split between Walmart and Oracle). It just got temporarily disrupted by his 2020 election loss.</p><p>Trump still didn’t truly get what he really wanted: reporting in the Financial Times suggests that China will still technically own and control the algorithm used to power TikTok, something Trump had previously said was essential to any deal. Early reporting by the Wall Street Journal also indicates that existing TikTok users will have to migrate to a new app.</p><p>...</p><p>I’ve noted more times than I can count that the push to ban TikTok was never really about protecting American privacy. If that were true, we would pass a real privacy law and craft serious penalties for companies and executives that play fast and loose with sensitive American data, be it TikTok or the myriad of super dodgy apps, telecoms, and hardware vendors monetizing your phone usage.</p><p>It was never really about propaganda. If that were true, we’d take aim at the extremely well funded authoritarian propaganda machine and engage in content moderation of race-baiting political propaganda that’s filling the brains of young American men with pudding and hate. We’d push for education media literacy reforms common in countries like Finland.</p><p>Banning TikTok was never really about national security. If that were true, we wouldn’t be dismantling our cybersecurity regulators, accidentally hosting sensitive military chats over Signal with journalists, voting to cement utterly incompetent knobs in unaccountable roles across military intelligence, and letting dodgy data brokers sell sensitive personal info to global governments (including our own).</p><p>TikTok’s Chinese ownership did pose some very real legitimate security, privacy, and NatSec concerns, but the MAGA folks “fixing” the problem were never competent or good faith actors, and the push to ban hijack TikTok was always about ego, money, and information control. </p><p>...</p><p>Larry Ellison in particular has been very keen to leverage his massive wealth gains during the Trump era(s) to buy every new and old media venture his family can get its hands on, from CBS and CNN (Time Warner), to TikTok. Trump’s FCC is busy stripping away whatever is left of media consolidation limits to accommodate this massive right wing power grab. And TikTok’s a very central piece of the puzzle.</p><p>American authoritarians are following the same playbook we’ve seen in countries like Hungary, where new and old media and journalism is either destroyed or hijacked in service to authoritarian leadership. It’s happening here, now, and the very least ethical people can do is recognize it and put up a fight.</p></blockquote><p>From this perspective it certainly seems that we are very much in a new gilded age with tech billionaires now looking to control an ever larger chunk of our lives. The technologies that have been created and pushed by these people and companies are accelerating this control, and so far the public seems to be going along with it. The parallels between what&#39;s happening now and what&#39;s happened in places like Hungary could be instructive, if people are willing to learn about them.</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1nkk855/tiktok_to_be_sold_to_trumps_right_wing/neyib7x/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><div class="md"><p>It already is a propaganda mill.</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1nkk855/tiktok_to_be_sold_to_trumps_right_wing/neynsl7/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p></li></ol></section>]]></description><pubDate>Fri, 19 Sep 2025 02:30:18 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/its-all-good-its-all-good-says-mark-zuckerberg-as-his-catastrophic-live-demo-of-metas-new-smart-glasses-goes-horribly-wrong-you-spend-years-making-technology-and-then-the-wi-fi-on-the-day-catches-you/</link><title>'It's all good, it's all good' says Mark Zuckerberg as his catastrophic live demo of Meta's new Ray-Ban smart glasses goes horribly wrong: 'You spend years making technology and then the Wi-Fi on the day catches you' (pcgamer.com)</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1nkgcm8/its_all_good_its_all_good_says_mark_zuckerberg_as/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1nkgcm8/its_all_good_its_all_good_says_mark_zuckerberg_as/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1nkgcm8/its_all_good_its_all_good_says_mark_zuckerberg_as/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='separator separator-before-comments'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='comments'><p>Top comments</p><ol><li><div class="md"><p>When he attempts to be personable it’s like watching Arnie in that Terminator 2 scene where John Connor is trying to teach him how to smile.</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1nkgcm8/its_all_good_its_all_good_says_mark_zuckerberg_as/nexmwmx/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><div class="md"><p>This is one thing Bill Gates did pretty well.
