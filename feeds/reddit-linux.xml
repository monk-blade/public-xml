Of all the packages in the distribution, the kernel is the singular one where the version number is effectively meaningless. All it denotes is the kernel&#39;s <em>baseline</em> feature set capabilities, but is not representative of its current state.</p><p>For example, RHEL 9 ships a kernel package versioned as 5.14.0. This is purely just an artifact of when the feature freeze for RHEL 9.0 went into effect. The actual kernel today is more or less a relatively recent 6.x kernel if you were to compare the actual subsystems Red Hat enables. But instead of bumping the version number it gets conveyed as <code>kernel-5.14.0-570.44.1.el9_6.x86_64</code>. CentOS Stream doesn&#39;t use the intra-minor-version Z-Stream numbering, so you see it move from <code>-570</code> to <code>-571</code>, <code>-571</code> to <code>-572</code>, etc.</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1nk91ab/bluefin_lts_released_bluefin_centos_stream/nf86152/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><div class="md"><p>Bluefin just needs to offer a way for running rawhide. then they would offer best of all worlds.

First, these articles by Phoronix and Lunduke are the worst sort of mouth breathing Linux rage bait, and, second, Canonical is also moving way, way too fast to integrate uutils into Ubuntu, and putting Rust into the firing line (because they are Canonical and they can&#39;t help themselves?).</p><p>I think the uutils project is amazing.  I am a contributor.  But certain stuff still doesn&#39;t work the same as its GNU counterparts.   I just gave one example in another comment --  locales do not work at all.  See for example:</p><p>```</p><blockquote><p>./target/release/sort ~/Programming/1brc.data/measurements-10000000.txt | tail -1İzmir;9.9gsort ~/Programming/1brc.data/measurements-10000000.txt | tail -1Zürich;9.9LC_ALL=C gsort ~/Programming/1brc.data/measurements-10000000.txt | tail -1İzmir;9.9LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 ./target/release/sort ~/Programming/1brc.data/measurements-10000000.txt | tail -1İzmir;9.9```</p></blockquote><p>And while locales may not be important to you, when you expect a sort order according to <code>LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8</code> and get <code>LC_ALL=C</code> that could be a huge deal for someone else. </p><p>This has nothing to do with whether Rust is ready, or Rust is as performant as C, or whether uutils has edge cases (because of course it does!).   The real issue is that there is real functionality which simply hasn&#39;t been implemented yet, and won&#39;t be ready by next month.</p><p>And Canonical will blame anyone but themselves when and if it doesn&#39;t work out.  My guess is uutils will basically work well enough for most people.  UTF8 supremacy is a thing, etc.  But it will annoy the shit out of people who expect a stable system which does the same thing every time.  And there will be a dozen more half-assed &quot;articles&quot; and YouTube rants about whether Rust is the problem, when the problem is, obviously, Canonical&#39;s hubris.</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1nk3pes/ubuntu_2510s_rust_coreutils_transition_has/nev5q8j/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><div class="md"><p>The fact that the rust re-write is not GPL fills me with a dread foreboding.</p><p>A decade from now, when the big tech companies abandon a Linux they have to contribute to for a Rustix they don&#39;t have to share their work on, we&#39;ll look back at this as the turning point; the beginning of the end of open-source.</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1nk3pes/ubuntu_2510s_rust_coreutils_transition_has/nevpoi8/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><div class="md"><p>it&#39;s a new implementation. what do you expect.</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1nk3pes/ubuntu_2510s_rust_coreutils_transition_has/nevnxso/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><div class="md"><p>why are they switching to rust coreutils?</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1nk3pes/ubuntu_2510s_rust_coreutils_transition_has/nexm6er/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m glad I dumped Ubuntu just in time for this silly nonsense</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1nk3pes/ubuntu_2510s_rust_coreutils_transition_has/neygqzc/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p></li></ol></section>]]></description><pubDate>Thu, 18 Sep 2025 15:02:55 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://youtu.be/4YUkD5oslmc</link><title>Operese - Windows-to-Linux migration tool that's now open-source!

Many digitally sign their packages, to help ensure that what is downloaded is what the official packager created. Some (many?) do vulnerability scans of the software being packaged. The larger distributions have teams to monitor the latest reports of attacks against upstream packages. </p><p>There was a kerfuffle about a year ago regarding a popular package (I forget which one) that had a supply chain attack (I think the package build script downloaded a vulnerable tar file). I believe it was caught before any distribution made the vulnerable version available. </p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1njkby3/with_all_these_supply_chain_attacks_going_on_such/neqxpav/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><div class="md"><p>Javascript is everywhere. The recent &quot;npm worm&quot; works on linux just as well. However, the target currently are developers themselves, so if you are, you can just follow various recommendations how to set up your stuff to disable post installation scripts.</p><p>Else, It depends entirely on the repository and package. The more people who use a repository, the more checks and balances there usually are - because shit needs to be organized when a few hundred people work on it.  </p><p>For the package - same. The more people who use it, the more likely it will be spotted - not always at once. In the NPM world, if a package is popular, within a few hours.</p><p>The individual maintainer who gets targeted for a supply chain attack to start is just a human being. They might be tired, overworked or in a rush. They might have mental health issues. They might urgently need money. On the other hand, a core maintainer of a distro usually lives a relatively transparent life with their peculiar &quot;hobby&quot; so to speak and would not just throw everything away over night, or be easily bribed by a ransomware gang.   </p><p>Then it depends on the repository next - what kind of checks are there? What could set of a tripwire?</p><p>And next, what can the packages do after installation? </p><p>So overall, you want to not use stuff randomly on your daily driver. Do remove software and packages you do not need, do not &quot;hoard&quot; software and accounts. If you want to test random things or you usually are interested in something only for a while - set up a VM.</p><p>De-cluttering is one step, the next step is being informed - make sure you know where you distro posts stuff and any other repository you use.</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1njkby3/with_all_these_supply_chain_attacks_going_on_such/nerb8zs/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><div class="md"><p>Nobody on any operating system is safe lol</p><p>NPM isn&#39;t a linux thing either.  </p><p>I think the closest thing recently was someone putting some viruses on the AUR?
