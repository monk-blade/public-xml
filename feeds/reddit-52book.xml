Even though its slighly repeative.</p><p><span class="md-spoiler-text">It is not because we don&#39;t get answers I am deducting a quarter star. I like books that focus more on the abstract concepts of being lost without resolve. What annoyed me was the repetition of the exact same phrases like the title over and over again. I thought the passing slipped when they escaped, but its on purpose like the main character wasnt as focus like she checked out mentally and was thinking what method would be best if they did explore again. I just couldn&#39;t get over how there were 40 women including her and we barely know anything about them. I know they forgot stuff, but maybe they could have developed interests after escaping.</span></p><p><span class="md-spoiler-text">I did love how engrossed I was with NEEDING to keep reading I couldn&#39;t stop till I had devored it. The beginning was captivating, and I had to figure out how she discovers about King Lear. Since she mentioned him being just as important as her near the beginning. Especially since no one tells her anything let alone basic characters from literature. I hated how they would not tell her anything, but I know people do that they never stop seeing certain situations as anything but useless or seeing adults as children. Regardless what they accomplish. </span></p><p><span class="md-spoiler-text">I feel like I&#39;m not doing the good bits justice. Its good I swear. I just wish if they keep calling it alien planet it showed little bit more stuff to show us that its not earth (other than the endless cabins). </span></p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section><section class='preview-image'><p>&nbsp;</p><img src='https://i.redd.it/n9sv11wljspf1.png' /></section><section class='separator separator-before-comments'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='comments'><p>Top comments</p><ol><li><div class="md"><p>I loved it.

One of the few books I see myself re-reading, so I‚Äôm glad I bought it and not waited for the one at the library to become free.

I also really appreciated how much content there was, how much food for thought, if you will, with so few words! One if the thoughts that‚Äôs stuck with me, several months after reading it, is the human aspect: what makes us human? How are we affected by not having a shared memory, a common past and references?
