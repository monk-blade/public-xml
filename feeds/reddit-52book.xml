I mean, this is a book everyone knows about. And many have made the conscious decision to never read a 1300 page fictional book concerning French history and a man inside this history. I had never read a single word of Hugo. And I have never seen any visual productions of this giant book. It would take a ten hour miniseries to do it justice. I don’t know what Broadway did with it. Ripped out the core I suppose.</p><p>Anyway, it is a gargantuan read. And I had been led to believe, possibly by the Broadway ads, that it was a book mostly about the 1832 Paris uprisings against the monarchists. I can now safely reveal that the barricades don’t go up or appear until after page 900. You have woven through so many character events and crisscrossings by then you have forgotten the barricades were even coming. And Hugo is a great believer in sidelines, explanations and tangential discourses that disrupt the central sequence in the life of Jean Valjean and all who come in contact with him. I mean my very good biography of Napoleon dedicates 3 pages to the battle of Waterloo. Hugo runs off 51 pages on the battle, in impressive detail which I can only believe is mainly truthful history and not Hugo making shit up. Only to have two characters in the aftermath in the dark among piles of dead and dying horses and wounded men and corpses meet briefly. Surely an impressive and costly sequence to visually recreate. I doubt the movies even bothered. (I will see.) There are sidelines on city sewage systems and Paris’ sewer system in particular and in detail. There are sidelines on the origins of street slang and its importance. There are long sidelines on the influential religious figure in JV’s early life. Hugo can make you want to pull your hair out before returning to the central plot line of Jean, Javert, Cosette, Marius, Thenardier and the gang that takes the barricade through its rise and fall. Good Lord.</p><p>Am I glad I read it? I would say yes. Would I recommend it to others? Damned if I know yet. You will need to just decide on your own. And I would not want to read this thing on anything other than a kindle with instant access to the hundreds of pages of footnotes and endnotes. Some of which are just distracting and unnecessary details and some of which are truly explanatory. Penguin clearly had some people diving into the mind and references of Hugo whether Roman, French, Greek, whether playwrights, writers, musicians, artists. The translator for the Penguin version is a damn genius is all I can say. And must still wake up with Hugo nightmares. (Shout out to Christine Donougher.) Jean Valjean’s journey is a long one. But there are many truly great fictional moments in this book. It may not be your cup of tea. But I can see why people still discuss it. </p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section><section class='preview-image'><p>&nbsp;</p><img src='https://i.redd.it/e4tnzobgj4qf1.jpeg' /></section><section class='separator separator-before-comments'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='comments'><p>Top comments</p><ol><li><div class="md"><p>Love Hugo, love Les Mis.

I like books that focus more on the abstract concepts of being lost without resolve. What annoyed me was the repetition of the exact same phrases like the title over and over again. I thought the passing slipped when they escaped, but its on purpose like the main character wasnt as focus like she checked out mentally and was thinking what method would be best if they did explore again. I just couldn&#39;t get over how there were 40 women including her and we barely know anything about them.
