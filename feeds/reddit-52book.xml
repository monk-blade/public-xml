Reading kept me going during the hardest month of my life. Moby-Dick and Crime and Punishment are two books have left an indelible mark on my soul. Reading about Raskolnikov and Ahab taught me so much about myself. I finished Notes the week I was released and now I’ve started the Brothers Karamazov. Hoping to read Master and Margarita and War and Peace by the end of the year. At the risk of sounding dramatic, my rediscovery of reading in the hospital has given my life meaning, joy, and peace.</p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section><section class='preview-image'><p>&nbsp;</p><img src='https://i.redd.it/qnh7vnpp41qf1.jpeg' /></section><section class='separator separator-before-comments'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='comments'><p>Top comments</p><ol><li><div class="md"><p>Ah yes, the whale book, that has jack all to do with whales.</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/52book/comments/1nkr5sy/finished_mobydick_and_crime_and_punishment_in_the/nf0dwvt/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><div class="md"><p>Get well soon… yes.. books have done that for me too… I believe every book has something to say to you…</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/52book/comments/1nkr5sy/finished_mobydick_and_crime_and_punishment_in_the/nf09kw0/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><div class="md"><p>I have that edition of notes from underground and wanted to get C&amp;P to match it, but the paper was so thin and cheap!

Even though its slighly repeative.</p><p><span class="md-spoiler-text">It is not because we don&#39;t get answers I am deducting a quarter star. I like books that focus more on the abstract concepts of being lost without resolve. What annoyed me was the repetition of the exact same phrases like the title over and over again. I thought the passing slipped when they escaped, but its on purpose like the main character wasnt as focus like she checked out mentally and was thinking what method would be best if they did explore again. I just couldn&#39;t get over how there were 40 women including her and we barely know anything about them. I know they forgot stuff, but maybe they could have developed interests after escaping.</span></p><p><span class="md-spoiler-text">I did love how engrossed I was with NEEDING to keep reading I couldn&#39;t stop till I had devored it. The beginning was captivating, and I had to figure out how she discovers about King Lear. Since she mentioned him being just as important as her near the beginning. Especially since no one tells her anything let alone basic characters from literature. I hated how they would not tell her anything, but I know people do that they never stop seeing certain situations as anything but useless or seeing adults as children. Regardless what they accomplish. </span></p><p><span class="md-spoiler-text">I feel like I&#39;m not doing the good bits justice. Its good I swear. I just wish if they keep calling it alien planet it showed little bit more stuff to show us that its not earth (other than the endless cabins). </span></p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section><section class='preview-image'><p>&nbsp;</p><img src='https://i.redd.it/n9sv11wljspf1.png' /></section><section class='separator separator-before-comments'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='comments'><p>Top comments</p><ol><li><div class="md"><p>This book stayed with me.

This seems intentional as these kinds of posts generate “clicks” and therefore advertising revenue.</p></li><li><p>Human rights failures: Poor moderation in countries like Myanmar allowed hate speech to spread and led to violence and sexual assaults.</p></li><li><p>Censored or adjusted rules under political and market pressure while continuing to claim they were following their long standing practices.</p></li><li><p>Toxic culture: Sexual harassment, retaliation, and dismissive workplace practices seem to run rampant at Facebook.</p></li><li><p>Collected and used user data in invasive, manipulative ways.  Most notably in allowing advertisers to target depressed people or teens with self esteem issues.  Facebook would show ads for beauty products after teenage girls would delete selfie photos.</p></li></ul><p>In one of those crazy coincidences, I deleted Facebook the morning of Charlie Kirk’s death.  I haven’t regretted it for a moment as I find myself able to avoid what sounds like an absolute shit show going on across social media.</p><p>On top of being a well written takedown it is also a pretty damn good memoir of what it was like to be a rising star in the mid 2010’s tech world.</p><p>Highly recommended reading</p><p>5 ⭐️ </p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section><section class='preview-image'><p>&nbsp;</p><img src='https://i.redd.it/9sfwmighgmpf1.jpeg' /></section><section class='separator separator-before-comments'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='comments'><p>Top comments</p><ol><li><div class="md"><p>I listened to the audiobook earlier this year as well, I thought it was a good book, but I felt a bit critical of SWW at times just because of how naïve she seemed. But maybe that’s just because I’m already jaded from growing up in Silicon Valley with friends &amp; family in tech and myself crossing paths with Facebook professionally, as well as the friends I have who work there, including one who worked on the internet.com project and it was wild to me back then and even now how obsessive MZ was over it. </p><p>Anyway, I digress. I agree, very important book.</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/52book/comments/1niyzmi/book_111_careless_people_by_sarah_wynnwilliams/nepi83q/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><div class="md"><p>I am always shocked/amazed finding out some people don&#39;t know that Facebook is an evil cesspool not just as an app but as a company - and haven&#39;t known it for a decade. </p><p>I enjoyed the book when it came out but ultimately gave it a lower rating - for the reason that the author actively participated, was complicit with everything, but paints herself as some hero for coming out a decade later with a book to profit about all of that stuff. </p><p>My review highlights:</p><blockquote><p>Infuriating insights bogged down by repetition and vague timelines.  </p></blockquote><p>Interesting overall but loads of problems with how things were delivered. Ultimately made me hate the dangerous people I already disliked even more - but the author waits to the very end to really accept any sort of accountability, throughout the book talking about how she chided others for actions saying the ‘following orders’ defense doesn’t work … then proceeded to follow orders for a few more years. At no point did she blow the whistle … I lack sympathy for these people who say all the right things several years too late despite knowing the impact in the moment. This doesn’t wash the blood off your hands.</p><p>But ... absolutely highly recommend reading!</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/52book/comments/1niyzmi/book_111_careless_people_by_sarah_wynnwilliams/neoeqyr/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><div class="md"><p>Great book.</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/52book/comments/1niyzmi/book_111_careless_people_by_sarah_wynnwilliams/neniapl/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p></li></ol></section>]]></description><pubDate>Wed, 17 Sep 2025 06:15:17 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/52book/comments/1niy0ft/how_much_time_do_you_spend_reading_in_a_day/</link><title>How much time do you spend reading in a day?</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/52book/comments/1niy0ft/how_much_time_do_you_spend_reading_in_a_day/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/52book/comments/1niy0ft/how_much_time_do_you_spend_reading_in_a_day/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/52book/comments/1niy0ft/how_much_time_do_you_spend_reading_in_a_day/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='separator separator-after-permalink'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='selftext'><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>And how do you make time to read??? </p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section><section class='separator separator-before-comments'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='comments'><p>Top comments</p><ol><li><div class="md"><p>It really depends on the day and how busy life is 🤷‍♀️ I usually wake up early to get a few hours in before breakfast and then a few hours in after dinner before bed to wind down.
