Coordinating inventory across suppliers, matching orders to available stock, processing shipments, and updating customers was an absolute logistical nightmare. So I built Orion, an automation that makes this extraordinarily complex process feel streamlined and effortless.</p><p>Orion uses Make, which handles intricate workflows flawlessly, and ShipStation to orchestrate multi-vendor order fulfillment. Despite the complexity, it&#39;s surprisingly straightforward to implement. Here&#39;s how Orion manages the chaos:</p><ol><li>Monitors incoming orders from Shopify and pulls inventory levels from multiple vendor APIs simultaneously.</li><li>Matches orders to available stock across vendors using smart allocation rules and availability checks.</li><li>Generates pick lists and shipping labels for each vendor through ShipStation&#39;s batch processing.</li><li>Updates order statuses in Shopify and sends automated customer notifications with estimated delivery times.</li><li>Creates consolidated reports in Google Sheets showing fulfillment rates and vendor performance metrics.</li></ol><p>This setup is indispensable for e commerce businesses with multiple suppliers, dropshippers, or anyone managing complex inventory logistics. It transforms order chaos into a smooth, predictable operation and eliminates countless hours of manual coordination.</p><p>Happy automating!</p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section><section class='separator separator-before-comments'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='comments'><p>Top comment</p><ol><li><div class="md"><p>Thank you for your post to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/automation">/r/automation</a>!</p><p>New here?

I&#39;m not a &quot;pro&quot; at coding nor have I practiced professional coding. I&#39;m just familar with the coding concepts they teach in College and I can read and understand code if I take some time. These are my skills.</p><p>My friend gave the idea to start a b2b agency where we would build ai chatbots, agents and other automations for businesses. Though I didn&#39;t have &quot;great&quot; coding skills I went with his plan. I saw people create chatbots and all with either no-code platforms or low code ways. So I was like &quot;sure let&#39;s do it&quot; and with the help of chatgpt, I created my first ai chatbot for a Mexican restaurant I made up.</p><p>I used whatsapp as my platform. So a whatsapp ai chatbot. It had like 10 dishes with its ingredients. I tried RAG for the first time. I made a file on notepad and put the menu there. Then with the help of chatgpt, I also created a very simple reservation system for that bot. User tells they want to book, bot asks for name, date, time, number of guests, and when user gives these, a Google calender event is initiated and books the slot for 45min. 15min extra is added as a buffer time for the restaurant to clear up previous diner&#39;s table. If slot is already booked the bot could also suggest the next available free slot. All of this was done on python, flask app. I would then run ngrok and then set the callbackurl on twilio. And I would chat with the restaurant bot. This was my first ever ai chatbot I (with chatgpt of course) made.</p><p>Then me and my friend started reaching out to local businesses in our area. Most of them weren&#39;t interested in the idea. And those who were interested said they didn&#39;t want to make a huge investment in it. After a tough month client-searching, we reached out to a perfume shop which was opening near us. They were really interested in this and said they want a whatsapp ai agent for their business which has the entire knowledge of the business and can book reservations for personalized custom perfume creation sessions.</p><p>After a few meeting they agreed to work with us. Our first client. After a 33% deposit of our original deal, we started their work.</p><p>I want advice and suggestions on the work I have done below and tell me if I&#39;m doing it wrong or if I could improve.</p><p>Using python, fastapi, flask, I created the bot. Used ngrok. At first I used twilio to route my messages to whatsapp but during testing and in the meeting with my client, many messages were being silently dropped. I was using the free trial credits. It wasn&#39;t because the messages were too long. Simple messages like &quot;hi how can I help you today&quot; were also being dropped. So I ditched twilio and then went with Facebook meta for developers. Since I used that, no messages dropped.</p><p>After having a simple bot functioning, I went ahead and connected the bot to a database. For my backend I used Supabase. Created a table which stores all the numbers, names and birthdays of users interacting with the whatsapp bot. A new table to store messages, incoming message and the reply of the bot.</p><p>I also created a user memory table where the bot can store memory of the user, like their preferences, what they like, what they hate, allergies, etc. I also created a seperate column for gifts where if the user says their wife/friend likes/dislikes certain fragrances the bot can smartly store them and bring up in conversations for a personalized experience.</p><p>Then I went ahead and created a table for the business&#39; products. Like 30ish in-house perfumes. At this point I didn&#39;t think it was a good idea to dump all perfumes of the business into the system prompt, so I created a hash table for all the perfumes fetching from the products table from supabase, its prices, notes, etc. create a cache and then feed it into the system prompt.</p><p>Now if the user says they want something refreshing or fresh fragrance, the bot can suggest one or two in-house perfumes that have a fresh feeling/notes in it.</p><p>I then created the reservation system. The bot detects intent of the user, if the user wants to book, the bot then asks for date, time and name and then saves into the &quot;reservation&quot; table in supabase, creates an event on the business&#39; Google Calendar a 1hr slot, and then the user receives a link to create/add the event into their own Google Calendar along with a thank you message.</p><p>I&#39;m a newbie to programming so for me there is sooooo much logic behind just a &quot;reservation system&quot;. This was where chatgpt couldn&#39;t help me but I would give chatgpt these scenarios and then it would give me fixes for my scenarios. (This could also indicate my inexperience in prompting) Like if the user gives invalid date or invalid time, if the slot is taken, if the user asks for availability, if the user already has an upcoming reservation/slot, then they can&#39;t book another slot, if they want to reschedule/cancel. All of these scenarios I would tell gpt and then it would help me make those fixes.</p><p>After making the reservation system, I had another task. The business has in-house perfumes of their own brand and other inspiration perfumes of famously known brands. Now this inspiration perfumes list was huge. Let&#39;s say 1000. So I created this table for inspiration perfumes. And with the help of gpt, my bot can now understand the intent of the user and then know right away if the user is talking about an inspiration brand perfume and if so, it can fuzzy match with perfume name directly from the database and then give its prices to the user.</p><p>Now all of this was done on vscode and with chatgpt. All debugs, errors and problems I would copy paste from the terminal and then also paste my program to gpt and then ask for fixes. I&#39;ve seen people talk about ai powered IDEs and I&#39;m not sure if I should use them. Im turning to reddit to ask for suggestions/advice on my journey and to correct me if I&#39;m going wrong somewhere.</p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section><section class='separator separator-before-comments'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='comments'><p>Top comment</p><ol><li><div class="md"><p>Thank you for your post to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/automation">/r/automation</a>!</p><p>New here?

People worry: <em>“If robots can do everything faster and cheaper, where does that leave us?”</em> But history shows that technology doesn’t just replace jobs—it transforms them.</p><h1>1. The Fear of Replacement</h1><p>From factory lines to self-checkout counters, automation often looks like it’s taking away human roles. And yes, some jobs <em>will</em> disappear. But that’s only half the story.</p><h1>2. The Shift in Skills</h1><p>When ATMs became widespread, many thought bank tellers would vanish. Instead, their roles shifted toward customer service and financial advising. Similarly, robots may take on repetitive tasks, freeing humans for roles that require <strong>creativity, empathy, and problem-solving</strong>.</p><h1>3. Entirely New Industries</h1><p>Think about app developers, drone pilots, or cybersecurity analysts—none of these jobs existed 30 years ago. With robotics, we may see careers like <strong>robot trainers, AI ethicists, digital twin designers, or human-robot collaboration specialists</strong> emerge.</p><h1>4. The Transition Problem</h1><p>The real issue isn’t whether jobs will exist—it’s whether workers can transition fast enough. Without proper reskilling programs, inequality could widen as some groups get left behind.</p><h1>Why It Matters</h1><p>Robots are here to stay. The challenge is making sure <strong>humans grow alongside machines</strong>, not in competition with them. Governments, schools, and businesses all have a role in reskilling and preparing society for this transition.</p><h1>Open Questions for the Community</h1><ul><li>Do you think robots will ultimately create <em>more</em> jobs than they replace?</li><li>Which industries are most at risk of disruption in the next 10 years?</li><li>Should governments mandate reskilling programs as automation spreads?</li></ul><p><strong>Final Thought:</strong> Robots aren’t just tools of efficiency—they’re catalysts of change. The question isn’t “Will jobs disappear?” but rather “What <em>new opportunities</em> will emerge in their place?</p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section><section class='separator separator-before-comments'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='comments'><p>Top comments</p><ol><li><div class="md"><p>Thank you for your post to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/automation">/r/automation</a>!</p><p>New here?

There is a reason why you dont have many onjekts with many motors inside that are used in an open environment.</p><p>And even if this would not be a hurdle. There is the compute part.

Every time a patient came in, the staff (sometimes even the dentist) had to sit down, write out the notes, and then manually type everything into their system (OpenDental). The owner told me they were basically burning through the cost of a full salary each month just doing this.</p><p>He asked me if I could build something to make the process easier. My first idea was straightforward enough:</p><ul><li>Dentist records a quick voice note after the visit</li><li>That audio gets transcribed</li><li>A structured summary is created (something like SOAP notes)</li><li>The transcript + summary get stored in a RAG setup so the clinic could later query them like a chatbot (“What meds did we prescribe to &quot;XYZ&quot; last visit?”)</li><li>Finally, the data gets pushed into OpenDental via their REST API (into PatientNotes or ProcNotes, maybe even as attached docs)</li></ul><p>On paper, that looked like a clean workflow. The problem wasn’t building it, the problem was <strong>HIPAA</strong>.</p><p>Suddenly the “simple automation” wasn’t so simple. You can’t use something like Telegram for voice capture, you can’t send transcripts to regular OpenAI or Google APIs, and even with n8n you’d have to self-host it, lock down webhooks, strip out logging, and run everything on HIPAA-eligible cloud services like AWS or Azure. Even the database for the RAG part would need encryption and patient-level isolation.</p><p>By the time I added all that up, it was clear this was way more of a compliance project than the clinic expected. The automation part is easy — but making it HIPAA-safe at every step is where the complexity lives.</p><p>Has anyone here actually built automations for medical or dental clients? How did you handle HIPAA without it turning into a monster project?</p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section><section class='separator separator-before-comments'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='comments'><p>Top comments</p><ol><li><div class="md"><p>Thank you for your post to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/automation">/r/automation</a>!</p><p>New here?

At a high level, it&#39;s a pretty simple system that scrapes law firms from a lawyer directory → crawls law firm sites for profile pages → then adds all those leads to a Google spreadsheet. Even though it is simple scraping system, it solves a real problem that was too manual for our client do by hand.</p><p>I wanted to share both the sales process we followed here, as well as the technical build-out of the exact automation we sold to give you guys some context on how we approached a client project like this. </p><p>We also make a Youtube video that breaks down the sales process + n8n automation in more detail: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtPUtfxQZYU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtPUtfxQZYU</a></p><h2>Sales Process Breakdown</h2><p><strong>1. Start with personal network</strong>Since we&#39;re pretty new, we went to our personal networks first. Thought process here, it&#39;s going to be way easier to get our first leads by tapping our network first. So we went through the list of people who we know that either ran independent practices or ran their own businesses. Jason, who is the lawyer in this case, was one of the top people that came to mind. </p><p><strong>2. Initial qualification call (15-30 min)</strong>We approached this by not initially trying to sell anything here. The goal was just figuring out if there&#39;s actually a problem in their business worth solving. We asked him where his business felt slow or manual, how he gets clients today, what (if any) process eats up the most of his time.</p><p>Within 10 minutes we both saw clear opportunities on his own process (lead gen).</p><p><strong>3. Discovery call (the most important part)</strong></p><p>On this call, our goal was to act like an automation doctor and ask a bunch of diagnostic questions to understand what part of the current workflow is painful. We had him go through the manual process he was following for lead gen in extremely detailed steps and went through every single step they were performing each day for finding new clients. </p><p>We had Jason literally share his screen and walk us through his exact process:</p><ul><li>Uses Texas lawyer directory to find insurance litigation firms</li><li>Researches each firm manually</li><li>Identifies individual attorneys that fit his niche</li><li>Copies everything into a spreadsheet (name, email, website, notes)</li><li>Sends personalized cold emails</li><li>Tracks replies manually</li></ul><p>Every time something felt vague during this conversation, we dug deeper. How does he use the directory? What’s the process for deciding if a lawyer is a good candidate to reach out to or not? More details here are better.</p><p><strong>4. The close</strong>Normally we&#39;d present our offer here ($2,500 build + $400/month retainer), but since this was one of our first clients, we cut him a deal in exchange for us to use this as a case study. This combined with the fact that this automation was directly tied to a process that would generate him more revenue made closing this <em>much</em> easier.</p><h2>Technical Breakdown</h2><p>For the build-out we have this system split up into two separate workflows:</p><ol><li>This is going to be the entry point into this whole system that allows you to paste in a page from the Texas Insurance Legal Directory. This goes ahead and scrapes all of the law firms that you can find from that page and then passes those details off to Automation 2.</li><li>The second automation here is going to be what processes each firm website individually. It takes in the firm name and a URL of the firm and then it goes ahead and crawls that firm website for any lawyer profile pages it can find. Regardless if the firm is a good match or not, we still go ahead and save that on our output spreadsheet with our decision here. This will get used by our client if they want to go ahead with cold emailing them or not. </li></ol><h3>1. Scrape the law firm directory (Entry to the system)</h3><p>The first workflow takes a URL from the Texas Insurance Law Section directory and extracts all law firms listed on that page:</p><ul><li>Uses Firecrawl&#39;s extract feature to scrape firm names and cities from the directory table</li><li>Validates each firm hasn&#39;t been processed before using Google Sheets lookup</li><li>Searches the internet to find each firm&#39;s actual website URL</li><li>Uses AI to verify the search result is actually a law firm website (not a courthouse or directory)</li><li>Saves verified firms to a Google Sheet and passes them to the second workflow within the core loop</li></ul><h3>2. Scrape lawyer profiles from each firm</h3><p>The second workflow processes each law firm&#39;s website to extract individual attorney profiles:</p><ul><li>Uses Firecrawl search with site-specific queries to find attorney profile pages<ul><li>Searches for keywords like <code>attorney</code>, <code>partner</code>, <code>associate</code>, <code>insurance</code> to find relevant profiles</li></ul></li><li>Uses a simple prompt + gemini-2.5-flash to evaluate each search result to confirm it&#39;s an individual attorney profile page or not</li><li>Scrapes detailed information from each attorney&#39;s profile using structured extraction:<ul><li>Full name and contact information</li><li>Position at the firm</li><li>Areas of practice and specializations</li></ul></li></ul><h3>3. Qualify and process each lead</h3><p>For each attorney found on the firm website, we then do the following:</p><ul><li>AI analyzes their the scraped profile page + practice areas to determine if they&#39;re a good match for insurance mediation referrals</li><li>Validates contact information to ensure we have individual email addresses (not generic firm emails like <a href="mailto:support@xyz.com">support@xyz.com</a>)</li><li>Drafts a personalized cold email using the attorney&#39;s name and background</li><li>Creates a Google Doc with the formatted email ready to copy into Gmail</li><li>Saves all lead data to Google Sheets, decisions made for determining if the lawyer is a good match,  and a link to the cold email draft</li></ul><h2>Workflow Link + Other Resources</h2><ul><li>YouTube video that walks through this workflow step-by-step: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtPUtfxQZYU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtPUtfxQZYU</a></li><li>The full n8n workflow, which you can copy and paste directly into your instance, is on GitHub here: <a href="https://github.com/lucaswalter/n8n-ai-automations/blob/main/deal_breakdown_lawyer_lead_gen.json">https://github.com/lucaswalter/n8n-ai-automations/blob/main/deal_breakdown_lawyer_lead_gen.json</a></li></ul></div><!-- SC_ON --></section><section class='preview-image'><p>&nbsp;</p><img src='https://i.redd.it/3zz4thkc35qf1.png' /></section><section class='separator separator-before-comments'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='comments'><p>Top comments</p><ol><li><div class="md"><p>We are planning to ramp up our outbound sales process in the near future for our agency. any interest in seeing more breakdowns like this on how we approach it?</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/automation/comments/1nl6lm4/how_i_built_sold_my_first_1800_ai_automation_to_a/nf35huc/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><div class="md"><p>This is gonna save me some legal fees.

My boss came back from some conference all hyped about &quot;AI this, AI that&quot; and now expects me to spin up an AI-powered outreach and cold email process like I&#39;ve got a team of 10 engineers. Truth is, I can handle basic outreach, but AI workflows? No clue. And no I havent been living under a rock, its just that we are pretty low-key with a few niche clients.</p><p>Me and my team have undertaken a few initiatives. First, we&#39;ve tried to automate a few things like adding intent data from Apollo and then doing an automated sequence. It didnt lead to anything good. Maybe im going about this all wrong and it&#39;s exhausting. I&#39;m writing follow-ups at midnight, trying to keep multiple inboxes alive, and praying our mail provider doesn&#39;t torch our domain.</p><p>Has anyone actually set up an AI outreach flow that works in practice? Like real-world stuff that doesn&#39;t collapse after 3 weeks?</p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section><section class='separator separator-before-comments'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='comments'><p>Top comments</p><ol><li><div class="md"><p>Your CEO got sold on conference hype and now expects magic. AI outreach is mostly buzzword bullshit right now, the tools claiming to &quot;revolutionize&quot; cold email are just doing basic personalization at scale that doesn&#39;t actually work better than good manual outreach.</p><p>Here&#39;s the reality: adding Apollo intent data to automated sequences doesn&#39;t make it AI powered, it just means you&#39;re spamming people who looked at competitor sites. Our clients tried this exact approach and saw response rates tank because the messaging is still generic crap with a thin personalization layer.</p><p>The actual useful AI applications for outreach are super limited. ChatGPT or Claude for writing variations of proven email templates works fine. AI for researching prospects and finding talking points saves time. But &quot;AI outreach flows&quot; that run themselves? That&#39;s fantasy land sold by software vendors trying to make a buck.</p><p>What you should actually do: Stop trying to automate everything and focus on quality over quantity. Use AI to help write better emails faster, not to send more garbage. Research 50 perfect fit accounts manually, use AI to help craft personalized messages based on that research, then send those yourself.</p><p>The &quot;multiple inboxes&quot; and &quot;praying our domain doesn&#39;t get torched&quot; tells me your infrastructure is already struggling. Adding more automation on top of a broken foundation just speeds up failure. Fix your deliverability first, then worry about scaling with tools.</p><p>For logistics SaaS specifically, your buyers are operations people who get hammered with vendor emails daily. AI generated outreach sounds exactly like every other pitch they delete. What works is genuine personalization about their specific supply chain challenges, which requires actual human research and thinking.</p><p>Tell your CEO that real AI implementation for outreach means using tools to enhance human work, not replace it. Show them metrics comparing your current automated approach versus properly researched manual outreach. The manual stuff probably converts 5x to 10x better even though it&#39;s slower.</p><p>If you must use &quot;AI techniques&quot; to keep the boss happy, use it for these specific tasks: prospect research from LinkedIn and company websites, email variation writing based on your proven templates, scheduling optimization for send times, and response categorization. But a human needs to review everything before it goes out.</p><p>The midnight follow up writing tells me you&#39;re drowning in bad process, not lacking AI tools. Batch your work, create templates for common scenarios, and stop chasing every lead. Focus on fewer, better qualified prospects instead of trying to scale crap outreach.</p><p>Our customers in similar situations who succeeded did the opposite of what your CEO wants. They scaled back automation, improved targeting dramatically, and used AI as a research assistant rather than an autopilot system. Their reply rates went from 0.5% to 8% even though they sent 80% fewer emails.</p><p>Bottom line: Your CEO doesn&#39;t understand that AI can&#39;t fix bad strategy or replace human judgment in B2B sales. Use the tools to work smarter, not to automate failure faster. Show results with quality outreach first, then figure out how to scale what actually works.</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/automation/comments/1nl3aak/ceo_wants_us_to_replace_our_manual_outreach_with/nf2ll93/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><div class="md"><p>Just commenting here for later on…we’re on the same path.

So if you&#39;ve got clients URL or any data about the client, just personalize a 3-5 phrase email icebreaker using an AI api. </li></ol><p>Set it up to trigger whenever you have a new lead in your crm or something. </p><ol><li>Set up a lead enrichment. So your on track with apollo but I&#39;d use instead use apify + apollo and some other enrichment providers + normal web scrapping via h ttp requests. 3. Automate follow-ups - So if you don&#39;t hear back from a client and you have conversation data and company data about the client, set up a flow that feeds that data from your crm to an AI model and craft a super simple email. With email automations, I really recommend automated draft creation rather than automated sending. Especially if your fairly small in volume. Otherwise you risk tanking your domain. Or just buy a new domain with a similar name as your brand and use that for mass volume automated sending. There&#39;s obviously a lot more that you can do and tbh you boss really is onto something when it comes to automation but they are going about it the wrong way. But some of these should keep them happy for a bit.</li></ol></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/automation/comments/1nl3aak/ceo_wants_us_to_replace_our_manual_outreach_with/nf2gvh7/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><div class="md"><p>Thank you for your post to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/automation">/r/automation</a>!</p><p>New here?

Start by consolidating all your stuff into one outreach platform, I used Instantly, but any solid one will do.

We just helped a small skin aesthetic clinic in Dubai fix a major leak in their business: their lead follow-up process. They were literally losing about $10,000 every month because inquiries were falling through the cracks, they were missing a lot of calls and even follow ups. </p><p><strong>What was happening:</strong> The clinic relied only on a receptionist to handle calls and a basic google form. If a potential client reached out after hours or via Instagram, chances were they’d get no response until the next day (if at all). By then, the lead often went to a competitor or went cold. Even during the day, the receptionists were overwhelmed – she’d miss calls while on other calls, forget to follow up with people etc. No CRM, no automation, just pen-and-paper and manual database management. The result? Dozens of interested customer inquiries slipping away. </p><p>So we built a simple but effective automation workflow (using n8n) to support their existing process. Key steps we implemented:</p><ul><li><strong>Instant acknowledgment:</strong> Whenever someone fills the website form or sends a message, they get an immediate WhatsApp reply saying “Thanks for contacting, we’ll be with you ASAP” with the clinic’s name. No more radio silence. This happens 24/7 within seconds.</li><li><strong>Lead logging:</strong> That inquiry automatically goes into a Google Sheet (shared with the clinic) so no lead is forgotten. The receptionist sees the new entry and the details when she starts work.</li><li><strong>Notify staff:</strong> The system shoots an email alert to the receptionist (and clinic manager) that a new lead came in, with all details. Now they know who to call and why, first thing in the morning or sooner.</li><li><strong>Faster follow-up:</strong> Because the lead got a WhatsApp message, they often even reply with more info or preferred appointment times. When the receptionist follows up, she has context and the client already feels taken care of. We also gave them a Calendly link to send for scheduling if someone prefers self-service booking.</li><li><strong>Reminders:</strong> Once an appointment is booked, our workflow schedules auto-reminder messages on WhatsApp 1 day and 2 hours before the appointment. This dramatically reduced no-shows (which had been a problem).</li><li><strong>Post-visit:</strong> We even added a post-appointment thank-you and feedback request. A nice touch that makes clients feel valued and helps the clinic gather reviews or testimonials.</li></ul><p><strong>The results (after 2 months):</strong></p><ul><li>The clinic’s conversion rate from lead to show-up <strong>jumped from around 30% to 50%+.</strong> They’re filling their schedule now. </li><li>No-show rate got cut in half<strong>.</strong> People actually remember and show up to their appointments now, thanks to reminders.</li><li>The receptionist saves hours of time and a lot of stress. She’s not juggling as much – the “system” (as they call it) does the tedious follow-up stuff automatically.</li><li>The clinic estimates at least $15K in extra monthly revenue from those saved leads and kept appointments. This is huge for them.</li><li>The clinic owner is over the moon. She said it feels like they hired an extra staff member who works 24/7, but for a fraction of the cost.</li></ul><p>After seeing the difference, they decided to keep us on a retainer for ~$2,000/month to maintain and further optimize the system for them. Considering they’re getting 5-7x that back in revenue, they’re super happy with that investment (and so are we!). This is our biggest retainer yet and it gives me a lot of confidence in what all we can achieve. (In the past, we have closed quite a few deals in the $1k range, which are pretty awesome too, lmk if y&#39;all might be interested in knowing about them as well)</p><p><strong>Key takeaway:</strong> If you run a small business and you’re spending money to get leads, make sure you’re not losing those leads due to slow or no follow-up. People’s attention spans are short, and speed wins. In our case, just <em>automating the initial response and reminders</em> made a night-and-day difference. You don’t need fancy AI or expensive software either – we pieced this together with pretty accessible tech (WhatsApp API, Google Sheets, etc.).</p><p>The clinic went from old-school to cutting-edge literally in two weeks without hiring new staff. I’m proud of the win, and the client is ecstatic. Just thought I’d share in case it sparks ideas for others here dealing with similar issues. Feel free to ask any questions; happy to nerd out on the setup or share more specifics (would love to share the JSON code for the automation we implemented; I am not sure if sharing the code snippet is the right way to go here, so if anyone knows the best way, let me know!) </p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section><section class='separator separator-before-comments'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='comments'><p>Top comments</p><ol><li><div class="md"><p>Awesome work!

But the reality is changing fast—service robots are slowly entering our homes, offices, and even restaurants. The big question is: <strong>are we really ready to share daily life with them?</strong></p><h1>1. From Factories to Living Rooms</h1><p>Vacuum robots and smart assistants are just the start. Companies are now testing humanoid robots that can cook, clean, deliver groceries, or even provide elderly care. This marks a huge shift from industrial use to <strong>personal integration</strong>.</p><h1>2. Emotional Connection vs. Utility</h1><p>Unlike factory machines, home robots are designed to interact with people directly. If they appear “too human,” people may become uncomfortable. If they appear “too robotic,” people may not trust them to handle personal tasks. Striking the right balance between <strong>familiarity and efficiency</strong> is key.</p><h1>3. Security &amp; Privacy Concerns</h1><p>A robot in your home has access to private spaces, conversations, and routines. That makes <strong>data protection</strong> a bigger challenge than ever. If these machines aren’t designed with security in mind, adoption will face massive resistance.</p><h1>4. Social Acceptance</h1><p>In cultures where human help is affordable and common, service robots might face slower adoption. But in aging societies with worker shortages, demand for reliable home assistants could skyrocket.</p><h1>Why This Matters</h1><p>The service robot industry is projected to grow rapidly over the next decade. But their success depends on <strong>how comfortable humans feel letting machines into their personal space.</strong></p><h1>Open Questions for the Community</h1><ul><li>Would you trust a humanoid robot to cook or clean in your home?</li><li>How much <strong>privacy</strong> would you be willing to trade for convenience?</li><li>Do you think social acceptance will be harder to achieve than the <strong>technical challenges</strong>?</li></ul><p><strong>Final Thought:</strong> The technology is already here. The real challenge is whether society is emotionally and culturally ready for service robots to become part of our everyday lives.</p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section><section class='separator separator-before-comments'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='comments'><p>Top comment</p><ol><li><div class="md"><p>Thank you for your post to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/automation">/r/automation</a>!</p><p>New here?

But once things need to run in production, dev teams get pulled in to rewrite those workflows in code. The usual reasons? Cost, scalability, error handling, maintainability… and just making sure it doesn’t break at 3AM. </p><p>If you know some coding, AI can actually help bridge that gap. For example, you can export the JSON plan from a n8n workflow and ask Claude (or another LLM) to turn it into code. It works surprisingly well in many cases—sometimes you’ll need to tweak or “vibe code” a bit, but it’s a solid starting point. The harder part is then deploying and managing it in production (auth, scaling, monitoring, etc.), which isn’t trivial.</p><p>Another option is to use something like AutoKitteh. It has a built-in “vibe automation” capability: you can feed it the JSON workflow plan and it will generate a Python-based automation for you. With just a few clicks for authenticating the applications, like in no-code tools, you end up with a code-based automation that’s easier to scale, cheaper to run, more robust with error handling, and more maintainable over time—because it’s code.</p><p><strong>Disclosure</strong>: I work at AutoKitteh, where we build automation and AI-agent workflows similar to those people create in n8n. I often handle use cases like the ones I described above, so my perspective comes from both what I see in the community and what I encounter directly with teams building these solutions.</p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section><section class='separator separator-before-comments'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='comments'><p>Top comment</p><ol><li><div class="md"><p>Thank you for your post to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/automation">/r/automation</a>!</p><p>New here?

Some dairies link them up with software to log data automatically, which helps with quality checks or inspections.</p><p>Honestly, if you’re running a modern operation and trying to keep up with demand, automation just helps you stay on top of everything without burning out your team.</p><p>Curious, are you looking into this for your own setup or just exploring how it works behind the scenes?</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/automation/comments/1nk1mdb/why_do_modern_dairies_prefer_automated/neumwce/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p></li></ol></section>]]></description><pubDate>Thu, 18 Sep 2025 12:44:40 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/automation/comments/1njzmsf/best_free_youtube_video_summariser_ai_with_good/</link><title>Best Free YouTube Video Summariser (AI) with Good UI/Functions?</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/automation/comments/1njzmsf/best_free_youtube_video_summariser_ai_with_good/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/automation/comments/1njzmsf/best_free_youtube_video_summariser_ai_with_good/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p>Reading time: 1 min | <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/automation/comments/1njzmsf/best_free_youtube_video_summariser_ai_with_good/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='separator separator-after-permalink'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='selftext'><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey folks,</p><p>I’m looking for a <strong>free AI tool/website/extension</strong> that can summarise YouTube videos effectively.<br/>Ideally, I’d like something that:</p><ul><li>Works well with long videos (lectures, podcasts, etc.)</li><li>Gives clear, concise summaries (bullet points or text would be great)</li><li>Has a <strong>clean, user-friendly UI</strong></li><li>Doesn’t require too many sign-ups or hidden paywalls</li><li>Bonus if it can generate timestamps or chapter-wise breakdowns</li></ul><p>I’ve seen a few floating around but many are either clunky, limited, or push you to pay after a couple of uses.</p><p>What are you all using that works well and is actually free?</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section><section class='separator separator-before-comments'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='comments'><p>Top comments</p><ol><li><div class="md"><p>i use ChatGPT by copying the transcript and giving a prompt. it s not perfect but it s not that bad either</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/automation/comments/1njzmsf/best_free_youtube_video_summariser_ai_with_good/nev1psk/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><div class="md"><p>Just use chat gpt or perplexity</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/automation/comments/1njzmsf/best_free_youtube_video_summariser_ai_with_good/neu9f0j/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><div class="md"><p>hey!
