At a high level, it&#39;s a pretty simple system that scrapes law firms from a lawyer directory → crawls law firm sites for profile pages → then adds all those leads to a Google spreadsheet. Even though it is simple scraping system, it solves a real problem that was too manual for our client do by hand.</p><p>I wanted to share both the sales process we followed here, as well as the technical build-out of the exact automation we sold to give you guys some context on how we approached a client project like this. </p><p>We also make a Youtube video that breaks down the sales process + n8n automation in more detail: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtPUtfxQZYU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtPUtfxQZYU</a></p><h2>Sales Process Breakdown</h2><p><strong>1. Start with personal network</strong>Since we&#39;re pretty new, we went to our personal networks first. Thought process here, it&#39;s going to be way easier to get our first leads by tapping our network first. So we went through the list of people who we know that either ran independent practices or ran their own businesses. Jason, who is the lawyer in this case, was one of the top people that came to mind. </p><p><strong>2. Initial qualification call (15-30 min)</strong>We approached this by not initially trying to sell anything here. The goal was just figuring out if there&#39;s actually a problem in their business worth solving. We asked him where his business felt slow or manual, how he gets clients today, what (if any) process eats up the most of his time.</p><p>Within 10 minutes we both saw clear opportunities on his own process (lead gen).</p><p><strong>3. Discovery call (the most important part)</strong></p><p>On this call, our goal was to act like an automation doctor and ask a bunch of diagnostic questions to understand what part of the current workflow is painful. We had him go through the manual process he was following for lead gen in extremely detailed steps and went through every single step they were performing each day for finding new clients. </p><p>We had Jason literally share his screen and walk us through his exact process:</p><ul><li>Uses Texas lawyer directory to find insurance litigation firms</li><li>Researches each firm manually</li><li>Identifies individual attorneys that fit his niche</li><li>Copies everything into a spreadsheet (name, email, website, notes)</li><li>Sends personalized cold emails</li><li>Tracks replies manually</li></ul><p>Every time something felt vague during this conversation, we dug deeper. How does he use the directory? What’s the process for deciding if a lawyer is a good candidate to reach out to or not? More details here are better.</p><p><strong>4. The close</strong>Normally we&#39;d present our offer here ($2,500 build + $400/month retainer), but since this was one of our first clients, we cut him a deal in exchange for us to use this as a case study. This combined with the fact that this automation was directly tied to a process that would generate him more revenue made closing this <em>much</em> easier.</p><h2>Technical Breakdown</h2><p>For the build-out we have this system split up into two separate workflows:</p><ol><li>This is going to be the entry point into this whole system that allows you to paste in a page from the Texas Insurance Legal Directory. This goes ahead and scrapes all of the law firms that you can find from that page and then passes those details off to Automation 2.</li><li>The second automation here is going to be what processes each firm website individually. It takes in the firm name and a URL of the firm and then it goes ahead and crawls that firm website for any lawyer profile pages it can find. Regardless if the firm is a good match or not, we still go ahead and save that on our output spreadsheet with our decision here. This will get used by our client if they want to go ahead with cold emailing them or not. </li></ol><h3>1. Scrape the law firm directory (Entry to the system)</h3><p>The first workflow takes a URL from the Texas Insurance Law Section directory and extracts all law firms listed on that page:</p><ul><li>Uses Firecrawl&#39;s extract feature to scrape firm names and cities from the directory table</li><li>Validates each firm hasn&#39;t been processed before using Google Sheets lookup</li><li>Searches the internet to find each firm&#39;s actual website URL</li><li>Uses AI to verify the search result is actually a law firm website (not a courthouse or directory)</li><li>Saves verified firms to a Google Sheet and passes them to the second workflow within the core loop</li></ul><h3>2. Scrape lawyer profiles from each firm</h3><p>The second workflow processes each law firm&#39;s website to extract individual attorney profiles:</p><ul><li>Uses Firecrawl search with site-specific queries to find attorney profile pages<ul><li>Searches for keywords like <code>attorney</code>, <code>partner</code>, <code>associate</code>, <code>insurance</code> to find relevant profiles</li></ul></li><li>Uses a simple prompt + gemini-2.5-flash to evaluate each search result to confirm it&#39;s an individual attorney profile page or not</li><li>Scrapes detailed information from each attorney&#39;s profile using structured extraction:<ul><li>Full name and contact information</li><li>Position at the firm</li><li>Areas of practice and specializations</li></ul></li></ul><h3>3. Qualify and process each lead</h3><p>For each attorney found on the firm website, we then do the following:</p><ul><li>AI analyzes their the scraped profile page + practice areas to determine if they&#39;re a good match for insurance mediation referrals</li><li>Validates contact information to ensure we have individual email addresses (not generic firm emails like <a href="mailto:support@xyz.com">support@xyz.com</a>)</li><li>Drafts a personalized cold email using the attorney&#39;s name and background</li><li>Creates a Google Doc with the formatted email ready to copy into Gmail</li><li>Saves all lead data to Google Sheets, decisions made for determining if the lawyer is a good match,  and a link to the cold email draft</li></ul><h2>Workflow Link + Other Resources</h2><ul><li>YouTube video that walks through this workflow step-by-step: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtPUtfxQZYU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtPUtfxQZYU</a></li><li>The full n8n workflow, which you can copy and paste directly into your instance, is on GitHub here: <a href="https://github.com/lucaswalter/n8n-ai-automations/blob/main/deal_breakdown_lawyer_lead_gen.json">https://github.com/lucaswalter/n8n-ai-automations/blob/main/deal_breakdown_lawyer_lead_gen.json</a></li></ul></div><!-- SC_ON --></section><section class='preview-image'><p>&nbsp;</p><img src='https://i.redd.it/3zz4thkc35qf1.png' /></section><section class='separator separator-before-comments'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='comments'><p>Top comments</p><ol><li><div class="md"><p>We are planning to ramp up our outbound sales process in the near future for our agency. any interest in seeing more breakdowns like this on how we approach it?</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/automation/comments/1nl6lm4/how_i_built_sold_my_first_1800_ai_automation_to_a/nf35huc/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><div class="md"><p>This is gonna save me some legal fees.

We just helped a small skin aesthetic clinic in Dubai fix a major leak in their business: their lead follow-up process. They were literally losing about $10,000 every month because inquiries were falling through the cracks, they were missing a lot of calls and even follow ups. </p><p><strong>What was happening:</strong> The clinic relied only on a receptionist to handle calls and a basic google form. If a potential client reached out after hours or via Instagram, chances were they’d get no response until the next day (if at all). By then, the lead often went to a competitor or went cold. Even during the day, the receptionists were overwhelmed – she’d miss calls while on other calls, forget to follow up with people etc. No CRM, no automation, just pen-and-paper and manual database management. The result? Dozens of interested customer inquiries slipping away. </p><p>So we built a simple but effective automation workflow (using n8n) to support their existing process. Key steps we implemented:</p><ul><li><strong>Instant acknowledgment:</strong> Whenever someone fills the website form or sends a message, they get an immediate WhatsApp reply saying “Thanks for contacting, we’ll be with you ASAP” with the clinic’s name. No more radio silence. This happens 24/7 within seconds.</li><li><strong>Lead logging:</strong> That inquiry automatically goes into a Google Sheet (shared with the clinic) so no lead is forgotten. The receptionist sees the new entry and the details when she starts work.</li><li><strong>Notify staff:</strong> The system shoots an email alert to the receptionist (and clinic manager) that a new lead came in, with all details. Now they know who to call and why, first thing in the morning or sooner.</li><li><strong>Faster follow-up:</strong> Because the lead got a WhatsApp message, they often even reply with more info or preferred appointment times. When the receptionist follows up, she has context and the client already feels taken care of. We also gave them a Calendly link to send for scheduling if someone prefers self-service booking.</li><li><strong>Reminders:</strong> Once an appointment is booked, our workflow schedules auto-reminder messages on WhatsApp 1 day and 2 hours before the appointment. This dramatically reduced no-shows (which had been a problem).</li><li><strong>Post-visit:</strong> We even added a post-appointment thank-you and feedback request. A nice touch that makes clients feel valued and helps the clinic gather reviews or testimonials.</li></ul><p><strong>The results (after 2 months):</strong></p><ul><li>The clinic’s conversion rate from lead to show-up <strong>jumped from around 30% to 50%+.</strong> They’re filling their schedule now. </li><li>No-show rate got cut in half<strong>.</strong> People actually remember and show up to their appointments now, thanks to reminders.</li><li>The receptionist saves hours of time and a lot of stress. She’s not juggling as much – the “system” (as they call it) does the tedious follow-up stuff automatically.</li><li>The clinic estimates at least $15K in extra monthly revenue from those saved leads and kept appointments. This is huge for them.</li><li>The clinic owner is over the moon. She said it feels like they hired an extra staff member who works 24/7, but for a fraction of the cost.</li></ul><p>After seeing the difference, they decided to keep us on a retainer for ~$2,000/month to maintain and further optimize the system for them. Considering they’re getting 5-7x that back in revenue, they’re super happy with that investment (and so are we!). This is our biggest retainer yet and it gives me a lot of confidence in what all we can achieve. (In the past, we have closed quite a few deals in the $1k range, which are pretty awesome too, lmk if y&#39;all might be interested in knowing about them as well)</p><p><strong>Key takeaway:</strong> If you run a small business and you’re spending money to get leads, make sure you’re not losing those leads due to slow or no follow-up. People’s attention spans are short, and speed wins. In our case, just <em>automating the initial response and reminders</em> made a night-and-day difference. You don’t need fancy AI or expensive software either – we pieced this together with pretty accessible tech (WhatsApp API, Google Sheets, etc.).</p><p>The clinic went from old-school to cutting-edge literally in two weeks without hiring new staff. I’m proud of the win, and the client is ecstatic. Just thought I’d share in case it sparks ideas for others here dealing with similar issues. Feel free to ask any questions; happy to nerd out on the setup or share more specifics (would love to share the JSON code for the automation we implemented; I am not sure if sharing the code snippet is the right way to go here, so if anyone knows the best way, let me know!) </p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section><section class='separator separator-before-comments'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='comments'><p>Top comments</p><ol><li><div class="md"><p>Awesome work!

But once things need to run in production, dev teams get pulled in to rewrite those workflows in code. The usual reasons? Cost, scalability, error handling, maintainability… and just making sure it doesn’t break at 3AM. </p><p>If you know some coding, AI can actually help bridge that gap. For example, you can export the JSON plan from a n8n workflow and ask Claude (or another LLM) to turn it into code. It works surprisingly well in many cases—sometimes you’ll need to tweak or “vibe code” a bit, but it’s a solid starting point. The harder part is then deploying and managing it in production (auth, scaling, monitoring, etc.), which isn’t trivial.</p><p>Another option is to use something like AutoKitteh. It has a built-in “vibe automation” capability: you can feed it the JSON workflow plan and it will generate a Python-based automation for you. With just a few clicks for authenticating the applications, like in no-code tools, you end up with a code-based automation that’s easier to scale, cheaper to run, more robust with error handling, and more maintainable over time—because it’s code.</p><p><strong>Disclosure</strong>: I work at AutoKitteh, where we build automation and AI-agent workflows similar to those people create in n8n. I often handle use cases like the ones I described above, so my perspective comes from both what I see in the community and what I encounter directly with teams building these solutions.</p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section><section class='separator separator-before-comments'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='comments'><p>Top comment</p><ol><li><div class="md"><p>Thank you for your post to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/automation">/r/automation</a>!</p><p>New here?

Burnout is real.</p><p>full disclosure, i work at eesel AI, and we&#39;re obsessed with this kind of stuff. We&#39;ve been applying a similar principle to our own knowledge base. Instead of creating articles from scratch, our AI analyzes resolved support tickets and automatically drafts help center articles based on successful solutions. It’s been a massive help for finding and filling content gaps with stuff we know is useful.</p><p>It’s awesome to see how people are using different sources whether it&#39;s prompts like in your case or past conversations like in ours to scale up content creation.
