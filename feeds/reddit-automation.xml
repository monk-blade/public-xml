We just helped a small skin aesthetic clinic in Dubai fix a major leak in their business: their lead follow-up process. They were literally losing about $10,000 every month because inquiries were falling through the cracks, they were missing a lot of calls and even follow ups. </p><p><strong>What was happening:</strong> The clinic relied only on a receptionist to handle calls and a basic google form. If a potential client reached out after hours or via Instagram, chances were they’d get no response until the next day (if at all). By then, the lead often went to a competitor or went cold. Even during the day, the receptionists were overwhelmed – she’d miss calls while on other calls, forget to follow up with people etc. No CRM, no automation, just pen-and-paper and manual database management. The result? Dozens of interested customer inquiries slipping away. </p><p>So we built a simple but effective automation workflow (using n8n) to support their existing process. Key steps we implemented:</p><ul><li><strong>Instant acknowledgment:</strong> Whenever someone fills the website form or sends a message, they get an immediate WhatsApp reply saying “Thanks for contacting, we’ll be with you ASAP” with the clinic’s name. No more radio silence. This happens 24/7 within seconds.</li><li><strong>Lead logging:</strong> That inquiry automatically goes into a Google Sheet (shared with the clinic) so no lead is forgotten. The receptionist sees the new entry and the details when she starts work.</li><li><strong>Notify staff:</strong> The system shoots an email alert to the receptionist (and clinic manager) that a new lead came in, with all details. Now they know who to call and why, first thing in the morning or sooner.</li><li><strong>Faster follow-up:</strong> Because the lead got a WhatsApp message, they often even reply with more info or preferred appointment times. When the receptionist follows up, she has context and the client already feels taken care of. We also gave them a Calendly link to send for scheduling if someone prefers self-service booking.</li><li><strong>Reminders:</strong> Once an appointment is booked, our workflow schedules auto-reminder messages on WhatsApp 1 day and 2 hours before the appointment. This dramatically reduced no-shows (which had been a problem).</li><li><strong>Post-visit:</strong> We even added a post-appointment thank-you and feedback request. A nice touch that makes clients feel valued and helps the clinic gather reviews or testimonials.</li></ul><p><strong>The results (after 2 months):</strong></p><ul><li>The clinic’s conversion rate from lead to show-up <strong>jumped from around 30% to 50%+.</strong> They’re filling their schedule now. </li><li>No-show rate got cut in half<strong>.</strong> People actually remember and show up to their appointments now, thanks to reminders.</li><li>The receptionist saves hours of time and a lot of stress. She’s not juggling as much – the “system” (as they call it) does the tedious follow-up stuff automatically.</li><li>The clinic estimates at least $15K in extra monthly revenue from those saved leads and kept appointments. This is huge for them.</li><li>The clinic owner is over the moon. She said it feels like they hired an extra staff member who works 24/7, but for a fraction of the cost.</li></ul><p>After seeing the difference, they decided to keep us on a retainer for ~$2,000/month to maintain and further optimize the system for them. Considering they’re getting 5-7x that back in revenue, they’re super happy with that investment (and so are we!). This is our biggest retainer yet and it gives me a lot of confidence in what all we can achieve. (In the past, we have closed quite a few deals in the $1k range, which are pretty awesome too, lmk if y&#39;all might be interested in knowing about them as well)</p><p><strong>Key takeaway:</strong> If you run a small business and you’re spending money to get leads, make sure you’re not losing those leads due to slow or no follow-up. People’s attention spans are short, and speed wins. In our case, just <em>automating the initial response and reminders</em> made a night-and-day difference. You don’t need fancy AI or expensive software either – we pieced this together with pretty accessible tech (WhatsApp API, Google Sheets, etc.).</p><p>The clinic went from old-school to cutting-edge literally in two weeks without hiring new staff. I’m proud of the win, and the client is ecstatic. Just thought I’d share in case it sparks ideas for others here dealing with similar issues. Feel free to ask any questions; happy to nerd out on the setup or share more specifics (would love to share the JSON code for the automation we implemented; I am not sure if sharing the code snippet is the right way to go here, so if anyone knows the best way, let me know!) </p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section><section class='separator separator-before-comments'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='comments'><p>Top comments</p><ol><li><div class="md"><p>Thank you for your post to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/automation">/r/automation</a>!</p><p>New here?

Instead of just asking questions you can set it up to handle multi step tasks, pull info from connected tools and run small workflows.  </p><p>Start by turning on Agent Mode, hook it up to the tools you want (Google Drive, Slack, etc.) then tell it what you want done (e.g. pull leads that haven’t been contacted, summarize them, and add to CRM).   </p><p>It&#39;s useful for auto-generating reports from different sources, pre-screening leads or tickets before a human jumps in, pulling content from a knowledge base and sharing it internally.</p><p>My tip is to start small and run it alongside your normal process until you trust it. Make sure inputs and outputs are clear so it doesn’t mess anything up.</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/automation/comments/1nj5mk1/how_do_you_actually_use_agent_mode_in_chatgpt/neptkbk/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><div class="md"><p>It&#39;s what they renamed deep research.
