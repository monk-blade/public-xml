My goal with this project was to spend as little money as possible and use as much recycled equipment as I could.</p><p>I work in IT and we get a lot of old work laptops that can&#39;t be given out anymore due to broken screens, keyboards etc. Why put them in e-Waste when they can be repurposed for a homelab (with the added benefit of a built-in UPS).</p><p>The front laptop is the pFsense router. My pfSense setup features a dedicated VLAN for Mullvad VPN, with all traffic policy routed to a WireGuard gateway. Leak protection is handled by a do not NAT kill switch on the WAN and a NAT redirect for DNS, which is then forwarded exclusively to Mullvad&#39;s resolver over the tunnel. The entire network is also filtered through pfBlockerNG.</p><p>The middle black laptop is running TrueNAS (with a 2TB USB SSD hanging off it), is the weak link here (due to said USB SSD). I already had the USB SSD lying around, but this portion of the Brokelab 3000 is the first to get replaced due to the obvious lack of connection reliability, SMART, performance, RAID, etc. But it&#39;s free lol</p><p>The silver laptop at the back is my Plex ARR stack media machine. This is the part I&#39;m most proud of. I&#39;m running a single Proxmox unprivileged LXC container using Docker to run the following services: Plex, Overseerr, Radarr, Sonarr, Prowlarr, SABnzb, qBittorrent, Bazarr, Tuatulli, Bookshelf (Readarr fork), Calibre. Happy to share the docker compose file to anyone who requests it (this was easily the longest and hardest part of the project, getting all the services working together and automated).</p><p>The whole setup cost me about $200. I had to spend money on the managed switch (for VLAN tagging), a TP-Link Omada AP to replace my previous residential grade TP-Link mesh network (again for VLAN&#39;s) and the Omada PoE injector.  I have MAIN, GUEST, IOT, WORK and VPN VLAN&#39;s.</p><p>Next steps: Replace the NAS laptop with a real NAS. A Xyber Mini SSD NAS has arrived so will start the migration from my shitty laptop NAS.</p><p>Any questions, comments or critiques welcomed!</p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section><section class='preview-image'><p>&nbsp;</p><img src='https://i.redd.it/djznmhow77qf1.jpeg' /></section><section class='separator separator-before-comments'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='comments'><p>Top comments</p><ol><li><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been interested in the idea of repurposing a laptop for something, but while I understand the benefit of having the battery backup, one day those batteries are going to turn into spicy pillows being charged at 100% all of the time. This particularly sucks if you&#39;re using a laptop that has a battery that can&#39;t be easily replaced (ie. diassembly required).</p><p>I would rather use a real UPS, but with all that being said, how do you trick a laptop to thinking it does have a battery connected so it turns on, as I understand this is a problem with certain laptops requiring the battery being connected (even if it&#39;s dead).</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/1nlhkj7/the_brokelab_3000/nf5nqck/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><div class="md"><p>I was drafting up my reply before I saw: </p><blockquote><p>The silver laptop at the back is my Plex ARR stack media machine.

I wanted to show the new server rack I built!<br/>I was in the market for a new rack, as my old one was very big and took up a lot of space. I came up with this one, which I made to perfectly fit under the IKEA Alex desk we have in our home office/tinker room.<br/>It uses 14U rack profiles you can get at music stores. It also was a little unstable at first, which is why I attached metal brackets to the sides. It&#39;s attached to the wall so the whole thing doesn&#39;t tip over when I pull a server out!</p><p>The top machine is the main server. I used to have two servers, but found it was more efficient to containerize all the 2nd server&#39;s tasks and run everything on a single, more powerful machine.</p><p>I&#39;m in college, so I also use this server for school projects.<br/>Being a student and working part-time comes with some budget challenges. The server has been upgraded piece by piece, from the first version I made in late 2020 when I was still in high school, until where it&#39;s at now! Other than the case, SSD&#39;s and fans, it consists exclusively of second-hand parts.</p><p>Specs:<br/>- Threadripper 2920x <em>(need the lanes and single threaded speed, not really the cores)</em><br/>- 4x 16GB 3200mhz RAM<br/>- 2x Quadro RTX 4000 <em>(I use these for LLM&#39;s, transcoding, and occasionally a gaming vm)</em><br/>- 4x 2TB random HDD&#39;s <em>(soon to be upgraded, I&#39;m running out of space!)</em><br/>- 2x 512GB WD_Black SN770 SSD&#39;s <em>(storage cache, LLM and gameserver storage)</em><br/>- 2x 256GB Kingston KC600 SSD&#39;s <em>(mainly docker storage)</em><br/>- 1TB random HDD <em>(storage for the surveillance cameras)</em><br/><em>-</em> PCIE Google Coral TPU <em>(person detection for the cameras)</em><br/>- Mellanox ConnectX-3 10GbE card<br/>- Unraid OS</p><p>The bottom machine is nothing worth mentioning. Just a basic system that is only used to clone or recover drives, or play music for when I&#39;m working on some project. I had the case leftover from the server I retired.</p><p>Behind the rack door is an APC 750VA UPS and some excess cables.</p><p>In the last two pictures is my backup server, which is also nothing special except for it being decently power efficient and keeping my data safe. It&#39;s in my room at my dad&#39;s place. One of the only advantages to having divorced parents; free offsite backup location!</p><p>Specs:<br/>- Intel N100<br/>- 1x 8GB SODIMM RAM<br/>- 2x 256GB random NVME SSD&#39;s <em>(mainly docker storage, 1x 2280 and 1x 2230 in a m.2 wifi slot)</em><br/>- 3x 4TB and 1x 2TB random HDD&#39;s<br/>- PicoPSU<br/>- Unraid OS</p><p>I hope you enjoy taking a look at my setup!</p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section><section class='embedded-media'><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/56n8kpory5qf1.jpg?width=2056&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7e0b082b08d2655238f169472b0a7b798d2a7141" height="2739" width="2056" /></p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/lr0ko7ory5qf1.jpg?width=2621&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=409644b018b811673e20850c465841e45992a4e3" height="3495" width="2621" /></p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/ue3xf3ory5qf1.jpg?width=3327&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=df3de80ef4d5b66fca7c3d7a488f9405ad41d284" height="2495" width="3327" /></p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/059073ory5qf1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=41dc86d4f8c04574eb07d7e2f4c23d0687eb0cc9" height="4032" width="3024" /></p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/sv9dk5mry5qf1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2366108dc1d2d2d12d4419e34ac73bcf75646557" height="4032" width="3024" /></p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/03a8i3ory5qf1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae6bc45aa9ac6ee1d957604c617a2d1593a22d27" height="4032" width="3024" /></p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/pntxn32x56qf1.jpg?width=1899&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2bdfc9ae8702a03f923e46cb4f14d83f623970f6" height="1899" width="1899" /></p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/mgv3om2x56qf1.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cae1db8600775d7fbeaf6354085dca69e43a7dce" height="3024" width="4032" /></p></section><section class='separator separator-before-comments'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='comments'><p>Top comments</p><ol><li><div class="md"><p>Nice build!

It&#39;s now evolved significantly since then, and has grown as I&#39;ve learnt what works and what doesn&#39;t. I didn&#39;t have much Linux experience prior to starting this, and didn&#39;t have any sysadmin experience at all. This whole journey has been an incredible learning experience, and I thank all those who have posted about their experiences, because without them, I would have had a much harder time learning all this.</p><p>Almost all my services run in Docker containers, and I plan on eventually moving all my <code>docker-compose.yaml</code> files over to Git as soon as I can be bothered. Backups are handled via rsync to an off-site rsync.net bucket, and I use syncoid and sanoid to take regular ZFS snapshots and copy them across my machines.</p><p>All of my machines (and most parts) were purchased second hand. All told I&#39;ve probably spent around $1000-1500AUD on my setup, which is really not too much, all things considered. Or at least that&#39;s what I tell myself.</p><p>Here are my machines, and what they do, ordered from oldest to newest: </p><h2>Jemima</h2><ul><li><strong>ROLE:</strong> Media download, storage, and serving.</li><li><strong>SPECS:</strong> i5 7400, 16GB DDR4, 2x 14TB drives striped using ZFS.</li><li><strong>OS:</strong> Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS</li><li><strong>INFO</strong>: Runs the *arr stack, Jellyfin, and a handful of other media/file transfer related services. Jemima is the machine on the far right in the first couple photos.</li></ul><h2>Julius</h2><ul><li><strong>ROLE:</strong> Firewall and network services.</li><li><strong>SPECS:</strong> i5 7500, 8GB DDR4, 120GB SSD, Intel X540x2 10Gbit NIC.</li><li><strong>OS:</strong> OPNsense v25</li><li><strong>INFO</strong>: Not really much to say here. I used to have nginx running on Julius as a reverse proxy, but I recently moved over to Pangolin, which works <em>much</em> more smoothly. He still runs an OpenVPN server as well as a couple other small bits and pieces. Julius is the Acer machine that you can see on the right in the third picture.</li></ul><h2>Jarvis</h2><ul><li><strong>ROLE:</strong> Main NAS &amp; miscellaneous service host</li><li><strong>SPECS:</strong> i7 6700, 16GB DDR4, 2x 2TB drives mirrored using ZFS.</li><li><strong>OS:</strong> Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS</li><li><strong>INFO</strong>: Runs Home Assistant, Vaultwarden, Immich, CouchDB, and Newt (for Pangolin). Jarvis is the Lenovo ThinkStation that you can see sitting next to Jemima.</li></ul><h2>Kourtney</h2><ul><li><strong>ROLE:</strong> Gaming PC.</li><li><strong>SPECS:</strong> Ryzen 5 5600, 16GB DDR4, like 1TB(?) of NVMe, GTX 1660 ti</li><li><strong>OS:</strong> *shudder* Windows 11 Home</li><li><strong>INFO</strong>: Ironically enough for someone who exclusively manages Windows machines for a job, this is the only machine in the house that runs Windows (hence the &quot;K&quot; name. All my Linux machines have &quot;J&quot; names). One day, when I can convince the wife, it will probably get Bazzite or similar installed on it.</li></ul><p>As for what&#39;s next in my Homelab, I&#39;m thinking about picking up a few mini PCs from work (I&#39;ve been eyeing them off for months 😂) and setting up a Kubernetes cluster on them for a while, and maybe Proxmox after that. </p><p>I also would love to upgrade to multi-gigabit Ethernet and a managed switch, but that&#39;s a big investment that will probably wait until I&#39;m in a larger house. Gigabit works <em>fine</em> for now, I can still copy files at 60+ MB/s over the WiFi no problem.</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/1nkwi5k/spent_a_couple_hours_cable_managing_my/nf15y4k/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><div class="md"><p>Any effort is always a good effort.  👍 Great job!</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/1nkwi5k/spent_a_couple_hours_cable_managing_my/nf13kic/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><div class="md"><p>If it works i wont touch a single cable</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/1nkwi5k/spent_a_couple_hours_cable_managing_my/nf18hlg/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><div class="md"><p>never expected to see a halsey or charli stan in this subreddit haha</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/1nkwi5k/spent_a_couple_hours_cable_managing_my/nf1i40l/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p></li></ol></section>]]></description><pubDate>Fri, 19 Sep 2025 12:22:10 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/1nkkf2y/yes_your_isp_can_detectblock_vpn_connections/</link><title>Yes, Your ISP can Detect/Block VPN Connections</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/1nkkf2y/yes_your_isp_can_detectblock_vpn_connections/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/1nkkf2y/yes_your_isp_can_detectblock_vpn_connections/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p>Reading time: 4 min | <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/1nkkf2y/yes_your_isp_can_detectblock_vpn_connections/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='separator separator-after-permalink'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='selftext'><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I make this post because there seems to be a mass misconception that your ISP can&#39;t detect or block  VPN connections. I&#39;m not sure why so many people think this, but I thought it needed addressed. Especially given posts about Michigan HOUSE BILL NO. 4938, and one of the most up-voted comments there being &quot;Banning VPNs and the other items they listed is literally impossible right now&quot;</p><p>It&#39;s a strange comment, because it is obviously a thought from someone who has never worked in an industry where the subject is important, yet is extremely confident. Your VPN traffic is easily detectable, and blockable at any network device between yourself, and the VPN server itself. There is actually  literally nothing stopping your ISP from doing it except a policy, a protocol analyzer and a firewall (and they already have the last two). </p><p>I work in the cyber security industry (incident response), as well as a network assessment/penetration tester/consultant (several hats).</p><p>Part of what I do in the incident response/security assessments role is detect the use of VPNs, or other tunnels on a network. </p><p>We do this to detect bad actors who may have a back door connection, or system administrators who may be doing Shadow IT to access the network from out of office using unapproved tools.  It&#39;s fairly trivial to detect when connections are using OpenVPN/Wireuard/Cloudflare Tunnels with a little protocol analysis. Most modern packet analyzers make this pretty easy. Of course, it&#39;s extremely obvious when default VPN ports are used, but either way, detectable due to how the packets are structured, as well as those initial handshakes. </p><p>Part of what I do on the penetration testing side is attempt to circumvent VPN filters. There are tools out there that can mask VPN traffic as Websocket/https, and several other technologies. There&#39;s not many open source tooling out there for this, and its fairly obvious to someone (or an AI) looking at the network traffic to tell something isn&#39;t quite right. </p><p>Considering lots of people can&#39;t seem to configure wireguard for example, imagine asking them to setup a Wireguard VPN proxy between their wireguard servers/client that translates the protocol to something else before sending it to it&#39;s destination. Imagine asking everyone to ditch all of the fancy cloud-flare tunnels, Taislcale, etc and instead opt in for implementing complicated protocol masking VPN proxies, and also expecting the ISP to not have some basic packet analysis to detect anomalous packets. Imagine how easy it is for a system to auto-lookup these VPN server IP addresses when suspicious behaviors are detected, and have open source intelligent tools API reply back with a service(VPNServer) version from an automated bot scan. </p><p>The other big argument was the fact so many people use them for work. Most businesses have IP ranges outside of data-center/residential IP blocks. To allow users to still conduct remote work with VPNs, they could just allow VPN connections to those IP ranges. The few exceptions can be told to get over it, or have their company submit their IP range for whitelisting. They could just as easily block VPN connections to your home itself without issue if your servers there. (It&#39;s probably in your TOS) if you aren&#39;t a business.</p><p>My point here is yes, your ISP CAN block your VPN connections. Yes, if you didn&#39;t know, your VPN traffic can easily be identified as VPN traffic, dispite the protocol. There are too many common giveaways. If you&#39;re curious, deploy something like Netflow/SecurityOnion on your network, and watch the alerts/protocols being used/detected. The data itself will stay encrypted, but your ISP knows what you are connecting to, and how. This also extends to generic tunnels. </p><p>This is something that is very real, and should be taken seriously. This isn&#39;t the time for &quot;they can&#39;t or won&#39;t do it&quot;. One day you will simply try to connect, and it will fail. There will be no large network change, and they don&#39;t need to come to your house. They flipped a switch, and now a rule is enabled.</p><p>It is happening right now. You can choose to stick your fingers in your ears, but that won&#39;t stop it.  </p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section><section class='separator separator-before-comments'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='comments'><p>Top comments</p><ol><li><div class="md"><p>I think majority of us homelabbers know this.

There is no technical reason that vpn traffic can’t be detected and blocked. The bigger problem is all the lawsuits that will quickly follow when remote employees cannot work all the sudden. Yes I know they can just leave the commercial ip ranges alone. But then, you’ll have ppl spinning up businesses just to get around the issue. In fact, country wide, homelabbers, criminals, hobbyists etc will find the cracks and get through them. Then they too will get shut down. It will become a long and nasty game of whack-o-mole on all sides. But the whole time this is going on, there will be lawsuits all over the place, and lawmakers will fold under all the complaints and crazy stuff happening like being constantly hacked by pissed off citizens. Then they will get voted out and replaced. All because they got the grand idea to tinker with a system that they are 100% clueless about.</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/1nkkf2y/yes_your_isp_can_detectblock_vpn_connections/neyougk/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p></li></ol></section>]]></description><pubDate>Fri, 19 Sep 2025 02:37:43 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://i.redd.it/dntn3hfy3zpf1.jpeg</link><title>Finally 3-phase 400V 16A for the Homelab (i.redd.it)</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/1nkhk14/finally_3phase_400v_16a_for_the_homelab/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/1nkhk14/finally_3phase_400v_16a_for_the_homelab/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p>Reading time: 1 min | <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/1nkhk14/finally_3phase_400v_16a_for_the_homelab/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='separator separator-after-permalink'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='selftext'><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>In order to balance the load on the houses electric connection, I finally got 3 phase with 3 individual single phase outlets contracted and installed 😍</p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section><section class='preview-image'><p>&nbsp;</p><img src='https://i.redd.it/dntn3hfy3zpf1.jpeg' /></section><section class='separator separator-before-comments'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='comments'><p>Top comments</p><ol><li><div class="md"><p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/3owzWgnMr5vS37fBsc" target="_blank"><img src="https://external-preview.redd.it/fEBPMsYjjHbqLDUJjC7uPVNb8v3Ab3HhyOeO3Q3AV5E.gif?width=464&height=200&s=627fc35f4baaa18755cf8bb67b9facac828126ec" width="464" height="200"></a></p><p>😍Sick outlets.
