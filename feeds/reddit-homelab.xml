I&#39;m not sure why so many people think this, but I thought it needed addressed. Especially given posts about Michigan HOUSE BILL NO. 4938, and one of the most up-voted comments there being &quot;Banning VPNs and the other items they listed is literally impossible right now&quot;</p><p>It&#39;s a strange comment, because it is obviously a thought from someone who has never worked in an industry where the subject is important, yet is extremely confident. Your VPN traffic is easily detectable, and blockable at any network device between yourself, and the VPN server itself. There is actually  literally nothing stopping your ISP from doing it except a policy, a protocol analyzer and a firewall (and they already have the last two). </p><p>I work in the cyber security industry (incident response), as well as a network assessment/penetration tester/consultant (several hats).</p><p>Part of what I do in the incident response/security assessments role is detect the use of VPNs, or other tunnels on a network. </p><p>We do this to detect bad actors who may have a back door connection, or system administrators who may be doing Shadow IT to access the network from out of office using unapproved tools.  It&#39;s fairly trivial to detect when connections are using OpenVPN/Wireuard/Cloudflare Tunnels with a little protocol analysis. Most modern packet analyzers make this pretty easy. Of course, it&#39;s extremely obvious when default VPN ports are used, but either way, detectable due to how the packets are structured, as well as those initial handshakes. </p><p>Part of what I do on the penetration testing side is attempt to circumvent VPN filters. There are tools out there that can mask VPN traffic as Websocket/https, and several other technologies. There&#39;s not many open source tooling out there for this, and its fairly obvious to someone (or an AI) looking at the network traffic to tell something isn&#39;t quite right. </p><p>Considering lots of people can&#39;t seem to configure wireguard for example, imagine asking them to setup a Wireguard VPN proxy between their wireguard servers/client that translates the protocol to something else before sending it to it&#39;s destination. Imagine asking everyone to ditch all of the fancy cloud-flare tunnels, Taislcale, etc and instead opt in for implementing complicated protocol masking VPN proxies, and also expecting the ISP to not have some basic packet analysis to detect anomalous packets. Imagine how easy it is for a system to auto-lookup these VPN server IP addresses when suspicious behaviors are detected, and have open source intelligent tools API reply back with a service(VPNServer) version from an automated bot scan. </p><p>The other big argument was the fact so many people use them for work. Most businesses have IP ranges outside of data-center/residential IP blocks. To allow users to still conduct remote work with VPNs, they could just allow VPN connections to those IP ranges. The few exceptions can be told to get over it, or have their company submit their IP range for whitelisting. They could just as easily block VPN connections to your home itself without issue if your servers there. (It&#39;s probably in your TOS) if you aren&#39;t a business.</p><p>My point here is yes, your ISP CAN block your VPN connections. Yes, if you didn&#39;t know, your VPN traffic can easily be identified as VPN traffic, dispite the protocol. There are too many common giveaways. If you&#39;re curious, deploy something like Netflow/SecurityOnion on your network, and watch the alerts/protocols being used/detected. The data itself will stay encrypted, but your ISP knows what you are connecting to, and how. This also extends to generic tunnels. </p><p>This is something that is very real, and should be taken seriously. This isn&#39;t the time for &quot;they can&#39;t or won&#39;t do it&quot;. One day you will simply try to connect, and it will fail. There will be no large network change, and they don&#39;t need to come to your house. They flipped a switch, and now a rule is enabled.</p><p>It is happening right now. You can choose to stick your fingers in your ears, but that won&#39;t stop it.  </p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section>]]></description><pubDate>Fri, 19 Sep 2025 02:37:43 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://i.redd.it/dntn3hfy3zpf1.jpeg</link><title>Finally 3-phase 400V 16A for the Homelab (i.redd.it)</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/1nkhk14/finally_3phase_400v_16a_for_the_homelab/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/1nkhk14/finally_3phase_400v_16a_for_the_homelab/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p>Reading time: 1 min | <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/1nkhk14/finally_3phase_400v_16a_for_the_homelab/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='separator separator-after-permalink'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='selftext'><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>In order to balance the load on the houses electric connection, I finally got 3 phase with 3 individual single phase outlets contracted and installed üòç</p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section><section class='preview-image'><p>&nbsp;</p><img src='https://i.redd.it/dntn3hfy3zpf1.jpeg' /></section>]]></description><pubDate>Fri, 19 Sep 2025 00:48:14 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://i.redd.it/5nq1ja59yxpf1.jpeg</link><title>Server on the wall (i.redd.it)</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/1nkbagz/server_on_the_wall/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/1nkbagz/server_on_the_wall/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p>Reading time: 1 min | <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/1nkbagz/server_on_the_wall/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='separator separator-after-permalink'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='selftext'><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have no room for a rack the size to fit my server.
