The backplane is cabled to the HBA, but maybe this is for software RAID? I can&#39;t seem to find any info on them in Dell docs, and I&#39;d really like to know what they&#39;re for. Most of my homelab gear is a bit older than this 14th gen though, so probably just something I haven&#39;t came across before now. Any ideas?</p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section><section class='preview-image'><p>&nbsp;</p><img src='https://i.redd.it/yzlovqfl47pf1.jpeg' /></section>]]></description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 02:41:55 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://i.redd.it/s39p0a0my6pf1.jpeg</link><title>Start of my homelab (i.redd.it)</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/1nh27im/start_of_my_homelab/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/1nh27im/start_of_my_homelab/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p>Reading time: 1 min | <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/1nh27im/start_of_my_homelab/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='separator separator-after-permalink'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='selftext'><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>well this is the start of my little homelab, not too experienced but was finally able to get a firewall setup and getting all my proxmox nodes up and clustered working perfectly, now its just trying to learn how to setup most of my services alongside each other, still planning and researching the best ways to do a nas system that doesnt break the bank, also ive seen a lot of people with racks and thats the next step as well ü•≤.Wouldnt mind some advice on what i should run or do next.</p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section><section class='preview-image'><p>&nbsp;</p><img src='https://i.redd.it/s39p0a0my6pf1.jpeg' /></section>]]></description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 02:08:23 +0530</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
