In its verdict, however, <strong><em>&quot;the Supreme Court stated that the SIT‚Äôs ‚Äúexhaustive investigation‚Äù found no violation of the law and asserted that it would not allow tarnishing news reports about the rescue park in Jamnagar, Gujarat&quot;</em></strong>. This decision effectively gave Vantara a clean chit and brought the matter to a definitive close. This decision was perceived by the public as favoring the powerful. [<em>No disrespect to the Rescue park folks and the Supreme Court here this is just my opinion and not a comment on your working or integrity</em>]</p><p><strong>Example 2: The Election CCTV Hearing</strong><br/>In another case, the Haryana and Punjab High Court directed the Election Commission to provide CCTV footage related to the Haryana Assembly elections, following a petition by counsel Mehmood Pracha. Within three days, the government amended the law to prevent public access to electronic documents and recordings connected to elections, justifying the change as a way to ‚Äú <em>preventing the misuse of electronic election records. This includes CCTV camera and webcasting footage, as well as video recordings of candidates, during the election process.&quot;</em> Doubling down on this , the retention period for election CCTV footage was also shortened‚Äîfrom 1year to just 45 days, after which the recordings would be deleted. This maneuver effectively rendered the High Court‚Äôs verdict meaningless.</p><p>Taken together, these examples suggest that even if Rahul Gandhi were to win his case in the Supreme Court, the government could simply introduce new legislation to block the release of critical data. And if he were to lose, public perception might lean toward suspicion of foul play [ <em>Again, no disrespect is intended toward the Supreme Court‚ÄîI deeply appreciate its strong stance on issues like the electoral bonds case</em>] .It would also effectively end any further discussion on the matter once the Supreme Court has delivered its judgment.</p><p>As Rahul Gandhi himself emphasized during his press conference, he will just present the facts, and it will ultimately be up to the public and the country‚Äôs youth to decide what to do next.</p><p>P.S.

A lot of people in the Hindu community might not really know what day-to-day life feels like for Muslims in India, especially those of us who are educated, working in MNCs, or just trying to get by. I‚Äôll also touch on the lives of many who do self-employment or menial jobs.</p><p>For most Muslims, life is very middle class or lower middle class. It‚Äôs about making ends meet, sending kids to school, and hoping they get a better future. Just like most families across India. But neighborhoods with higher Muslim populations often face systematic neglect. Sewage systems remain unchanged for decades, overflowing every monsoon. Garbage collection is patchy at best, and residents often pay out of pocket to a garbage collection man. Power and utility management is overlooked. Slowly, a neighborhood becomes a slum ‚Äî not because the people don‚Äôt care, but because the system doesn‚Äôt. And when residents complain, things rarely move once it‚Äôs tagged as a ‚ÄúMuslim area.‚Äù</p><p>Then comes college. An average Muslim student, just 18, wants nothing more than education and a chance to uplift his family. Instead, he hears taunts: <em>‚Äújihadi,‚Äù</em> &quot;university ko bomb se uda de, sab pass ho jayenge&quot; <em>‚Äúbomb the university and we‚Äôll all pass,‚Äù</em> &quot;tumhe to ISIS join karna tha na, yahan kya kar rahe ho&quot; <em>‚Äúwhy aren‚Äôt you joining ISIS?‚Äù</em> No matter how hard he tries to prove himself, in everyone&#39;s eyes he&#39;s already a terrorist/anti national, a man who can never really assimilate into the community.</p><p>If he pushes through and lands interviews, sometimes offers vanish once the recruiter or interviewer gets to know that the candidate is a muslim. Even when he gets the job, that‚Äôs not the end. Some seniors or colleagues throw underhanded or double meaning taunts and remarks or make the environment hostile. You can‚Äôt always report it either ‚Äî because you risk losing the job and starting the discrimanatory process all over again. So you keep your head down, swallow the insults, and try to move on. Not all is bad though, some colleagues are wonderful and supportive ‚Äî but it hurts when even they go silent when remarks on you get thrown around. You wish someone sided with you but nobody really does. So you have to take the insults and ignore it.</p><p>Then comes housing. Landlords reject you outright. Some do it subtly (<em>‚Äúonly vegetarians allowed‚Äù</em>), others say it plainly. The ones who do agree often hike the rent 20‚Äì30%. Which leaves many Muslims stuck in the same neglected neighbourhoods they wanted to escape through education and jobs. Like a perpetual cycle</p><p>And when projects like the Halal Housing community in Mumbai are launched to give Muslims dignity and a cleaner environment, opposition rises instantly. It honestly feels like <em>‚Äújeene bhi nahi denge, marne bhi nahi denge.‚Äù</em></p><p>From education, to work, to housing ‚Äî each step forward pulls you back. That‚Äôs the survival of the common Muslim man in India. Not a threat. Not an enemy. Just someone trying to live, in the shadow of a hate-driven separatist environment created by the BJP.</p><p>Me and you ‚Äî we‚Äôre not that different. We both want stability, dignity, and safety. So ask yourself: would you still believe that Muslims are a threat to this nation if you lived this life? Would you live a happy life in you were in my shoes and be proud that you were born in India ?</p><p>This isn‚Äôt a rant. It‚Äôs a perspective. An attempt to open a window into a life many don‚Äôt see.</p><p>Signing off. Take care.</p><p>*Since a lot of people are saying &quot;AI Slop/Chatgpt content&quot;, My actual passage was incredibly lengthy due to it being a lot more more heartfelt and emotional. I used Chatgpt to trim down the post for reddit because people usually scroll away when they see an incredibly long post.</p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section><section class='separator separator-before-comments'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='comments'><p>Top comments</p><ol><li><div class="md"><p>I‚Äôm a Muslim doctor, while I‚Äôve never ever gone through any of this.I do agree that I come from an upper middle class priviledged upbringing.I‚Äôve never stayed in muslim neighbourhood. I‚Äôve stayed in a mixed society with all religions.I‚Äôve went to a private school where almost all my best friends were of different religion and never have I ever felt different.I‚Äôve went to MBBS in a college where there were almost very less Muslims and I‚Äôve worked in places which where run by Hindu missions but I‚Äôve never felt like I was ostracised.On the other hand, I did work for a while in a Muslim hospital, it was run by Muslim charity, and I was time and again, told indirectly by Muslim colleagues, that a female should always wear an abaya or hijab if she‚Äôs a good Muslim.Approached for nikah, only because of looks.Given looks if I didn‚Äôt say assalamwalequm and instead said good morning.I don‚Äôt know about middle class and lower middle class issues, but the real issue with our community as a Muslim is, we just don‚Äôt want to get out of our cocoon. I‚Äôve only met ONE decent Muslim man in my entire life till now. Other than that, all either would preach or try to dominate me.Mind you, I‚Äôm coming from Uttar Pradesh and I‚Äôve worked in extreme rural areas also and never felt the so called divide from non Muslims, but always felt attacked by our own Muslim people for being different. I don‚Äôt drink or smoke. Or wear provocative clothes. I‚Äôm just another Muslim doctor who isn‚Äôt married yet, and working with normal clothes.Isn‚Äôt it so awful, that most of us, especially gen Z Muslims aren‚Äôt even able to find a partner because none of the Muslim men or women are sane even after studying a lot?I had a female surgeon, beautiful, amazing but forcibly gotten married to a maulvi sahab because well Deen is more important!all I want to say is, let us all first try to change our community. Our preachy nature, our inability to separate religion from work, normal life.We can be good Muslims without telling non Muslims that oh it‚Äôs only our religion that‚Äôs fine.Without telling them things.I‚Äôm a practicing Muslim, but unfortunately Islam isn‚Äôt the issue, Muslims are!Majority of Muslims are!I‚Äôve had a Muslim roommate who wouldn‚Äôt even have laddu prasad and would tell me you don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs haraam what if they mix gaumutra, is this how you try to mix with another religion?There is a huge issue with our religion and it‚Äôs high time we change certain things.I‚Äôve worked in UP, AP and many many states and cities and it‚Äôs the same everywhere.It‚Äôs high time we realize if we don‚Äôt change our obsession with our religion and our superiority complex nothing will change.I know I‚Äôll get a lot of hate on this.But as a gen z indian muslim female, a doctor that‚Äôs literally my experience.</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1njd6gx/perspective_of_a_corporate_job_indian_muslim/nepu7t9/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><div class="md"><p>Been working in Mumbai corporate for 8 years, have never faced any discrimination based on my religion.

Thats it. Me and my family used to run cleanliness drives and try and clean the surroundings. To which we used to hear comments from the community and no support. </p><p>One time we brought the Kachra dabba closer to the chawl so people don‚Äôt throw garbage anywhere they want. And we planted plants everywhere people usually dump garbage. U know what happened? People started dumping garbage in the plants pots!!!!!
