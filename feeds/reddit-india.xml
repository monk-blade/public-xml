Honestly, I’m confused and concerned.</p><p>Wild animals are part of India’s natural wealth. They aren’t just resources that can be “owned” by anyone. So how can a private company suddenly bring in thousands of animals under one project? To me, it feels like a private entity saying, “We’ll take care of the nation’s water reserves,” and then taking control of all water bodies.</p><p>Here are my main concerns:</p><p>National vs private responsibility: Wildlife should be protected by the government, with accountability to the public. Conservation is a collective responsibility, not something that should be privatized.</p><p>Ownership confusion: Do these animals become “property” of the private centre? If so, isn’t that against the idea that wildlife belongs to the nation?</p><p>Transparency and accountability: With a private project, how do we ensure animals aren’t trafficked, mistreated, or used for prestige rather than genuine conservation?</p><p>Best role for private players: If companies really want to help, shouldn’t they donate funds or support government-run programs instead of operating private centres that house such huge numbers of animals?</p><p>I get that private groups might have more money and faster execution than government bodies, but when it comes to something as important as wildlife, isn’t it risky to let them run it independently?</p><p>What do you all think — am I mistaken here, or are these valid concerns?</p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section><section class='separator separator-before-comments'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='comments'><p>Top comments</p><ol><li><div class="md"><p>This family got the IAF to make arrangements to receive their international guests to their family wedding.  </p><p>Building a private zoo is child&#39;s play for them.</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1nl7tji/how_can_a_private_entity_just_take_indias/nf3plqz/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><div class="md"><p>Plastic has been banned in India, especially in ecommerce.

I know what you feel like I’ve been there too. Is there someone in your life you ABSOLUTELY love? For me it was my parents. When I was in the worst phase of my life, I’d call them and talk about my childhood. They’d tell me stories and nuances of our moments together or the things I’d do as a kid. That alone would make me feel loved and give me a reason to go on. Because more than my pain at that moment - I couldn’t bear to see them in pain or cry because of me. </p><p>Call that person you love.

In its verdict, however, <strong><em>&quot;the Supreme Court stated that the SIT’s “exhaustive investigation” found no violation of the law and asserted that it would not allow tarnishing news reports about the rescue park in Jamnagar, Gujarat&quot;</em></strong>. This decision effectively gave Vantara a clean chit and brought the matter to a definitive close. This decision was perceived by the public as favoring the powerful. [<em>No disrespect to the Rescue park folks and the Supreme Court here this is just my opinion and not a comment on your working or integrity</em>]</p><p><strong>Example 2: The Election CCTV Hearing</strong><br/>In another case, the Haryana and Punjab High Court directed the Election Commission to provide CCTV footage related to the Haryana Assembly elections, following a petition by counsel Mehmood Pracha. Within three days, the government amended the law to prevent public access to electronic documents and recordings connected to elections, justifying the change as a way to “ <em>preventing the misuse of electronic election records. This includes CCTV camera and webcasting footage, as well as video recordings of candidates, during the election process.&quot;</em> Doubling down on this , the retention period for election CCTV footage was also shortened—from 1year to just 45 days, after which the recordings would be deleted. This maneuver effectively rendered the High Court’s verdict meaningless.</p><p>Taken together, these examples suggest that even if Rahul Gandhi were to win his case in the Supreme Court, the government could simply introduce new legislation to block the release of critical data. And if he were to lose, public perception might lean toward suspicion of foul play [ <em>Again, no disrespect is intended toward the Supreme Court—I deeply appreciate its strong stance on issues like the electoral bonds case</em>] .It would also effectively end any further discussion on the matter once the Supreme Court has delivered its judgment.</p><p>As Rahul Gandhi himself emphasized during his press conference, he will just present the facts, and it will ultimately be up to the public and the country’s youth to decide what to do next.</p><p>P.S.

He has always said that about the future. He failed miserably in his business because a priest once told him that his life’s earnings would come to zero. And because of that “prediction,” he completely neglected his business, thinking <em>“what’s the point of putting effort into something that will eventually become zero?”</em></p><p>In general, his outlook on life is very negative. The glass is always half empty. He constantly looks at other people’s failures to validate his own. Yesterday was one of that morning where he was being his usual, negative self. Most of the time I don&#39;t reply to his facts and theories because I don&#39;t think the way he does and I don&#39;t want to contradict him because he is a person that cannot handle a conversation if his views are not agreed upon. He gets very heated up and his language becomes derogatory. But yesterday I felt like speaking up, especially about the Punjab floods and not let his beliefs take the entire space in the room. </p><p>He follows some guru on the internet who has similar views about the future as him. Apparently, the guru had already predicted that there will be massive floods in Punjab and people won&#39;t even have clean water to drink. My father believes that the guru has the ability to foresee natural disasters and he is connected to the higher power and that higher power has informed the guru that there will be floods again in the coming future and the water level will go upto 25 feet.</p><p>All this talk from my father baffled me, that how one person can stray so far away from logic and he has always held this views about the world ending. Back in 2008 I guess when there were so many theories floating around about the end of the world and there was also a movie made about it, at that time too he stocked up groceries and all the essentials to survive. And now he wants to do the same by not investing his time and efforts in making his life better because it will eventually be gone. He needs therapy for sure but he doesn&#39;t agree on that.</p><p>I wanted to tell him that after the Punjab floods, there were studies about how that situation could have been avoided/minimised as there was enough data to support the fact that the things could go out of hand, but it was the negligence on the part of authorities that the situation got worse. Also things like money from Flood Relief to fill up the pocket of certain people also &quot;allowed&quot; the situation to get worse. But him being him, a person who cannot handle different views than his, got extremely agitated that how can I question the validity of the facts given by the guru. That I am some over smart kid who doesn&#39;t know anything about the world. &quot;Wait and watch. The reality will come to you and then you&#39;ll realise I was right all the time&quot; said my father.</p><p>I asked him that <em>why is it so hard for you to accept that people can have different views? Why do you get agitated on the smallest of things? Why do you have to become this foul-mouthed person?</em></p><p>While I was questioning him, my mother joined the conversation and she spoke about how few days back he got angry about something and said mean, derogatory things to her and twisted her arm to the maximum possible strength of his. This got me really angry and upset. There are times I feel like I should just beat him up for the domestic violence he does because apart from this incident, there has been several more where he was physically and verbally violent. </p><p>I confronted him <em>&quot;why do you do this?&quot;</em> He replied that she is the one who instigates me by doing or saying stupid things. <em>&quot;But that doesn&#39;t explain beating, abusing and the level of anger you show&quot;</em> I said. <em>&quot;I am not a regular wife-beater. There are just some occasions like this&quot;</em> he said. To which I replied that <em>how can you defend yourself or justify your actions? &quot;Some occasions? Not even a single occasion is acceptable! How would you feel if you get to know if your daughter is getting beaten up by her husband?&quot;</em> He said <em>&quot;One or two times is acceptable. These things happen between husband and wife&quot;.</em></p><p>I was just appalled by the views, beliefs my father has. He is such a negative person and tries to defend his unacceptable actions. He said <em>&quot;The way you talk to me shows that you don&#39;t respect me&quot;.</em> I said <em>&quot;Why would I respect a person like you? You&#39;re not worthy of it. You don&#39;t respect your wife, your daughter and your son! Remember how much you have beaten me when I was a kid? With belts, rods and plastic chairs? Always saying that I am not good enough and I won&#39;t amount to nothing in the future. I will be just a failure. Do you even realise what kind of impact that had on me? The way you treated me a kid has dropped my confidence so low that I feel like I don&#39;t belong anywhere. I am not allowed to be in people&#39;s life and nobody wants me. My career is suffering and it is having severe financial effects because I think I don&#39;t even deserve money for the work I do!&quot;</em></p><p>To which he replied <em>&quot;You needed that treatment because you were a slow kid. I was responsible to make you better. Back in the day, nobody questioned their parents like you do. It was a very much acceptable treatment which I have given to you. Children are disrespectful towards their parents now.&quot;</em></p><p>&quot;It was not acceptable back in the day and nor it is now. And it is not about disrespecting parents, it is about telling them where they&#39;re wrong. Nobody&#39;s perfect or an ideal person and if I point out the wrongs that you do, you don&#39;t have to get defensive. The criteria of getting respect is to be a good person first. Don&#39;t assume that you can be a terrible person and still be respected because you&#39;re a father - an elderly person who deserves respect by default&quot; I replied. </p><p>So all this happened yesterday morning where I just felt sad and shocked by how my father thinks and what he believes is right. Honestly, I don&#39;t like him at all. I just feel this responsibility towards him that I have to be there for him in his old age. Other than that, the kind of person he is, it is hard to feel any respect for him. </p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section><section class='separator separator-before-comments'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='comments'><p>Top comments</p><ol><li><div class="md"><blockquote><p> she spoke about how few days back he got angry about something and said mean, derogatory things to her and twisted her arm to the maximum possible strength of his</p></blockquote><p>I&#39;m sorry, but I had a hard team reading past this.

It gets worse if you are in a tourist-y place.<br/>Unfortunately India is a poor country with a large population and a section of people are going to try to earn their living by exploiting others. </p><p>When I am travelling in India, I tend to get the transportation sorted out before reaching a place. Like rent a cab for the entire stay or ask the hotel to forward a contact list or something. Relying on public transport on vacation seems to be not great; you have to look out for scams and be worreid about your safety the entire time. </p><blockquote><p> here it was like everything is just widely accepted</p></blockquote><p>The number of people losing money on scams in India is pretty high. At this point, we have started considering that every unknown call/message is a potential scam. For example, I booked a pretty good hotel in a tier 2 city through booking and I  got a message saying that my card details are not correct and has to be re entered. I ignored that and brought it up at the hotel front desk. They went like &quot;yes we are aware of the problem&quot;. Thats it. </p><p>For vacations I tend to plan either the north east or south or have a fully managed itinerary.

I also have hired guides that get good reviews on line to take me places that I don’t know. </p><p>I think the trick to India is that you need someone to help you through the experience, at least at first or to visit new places. It’s not a place for a tourist to handle all by themselves. </p><p>Consider going back with a really good guide or two.

I don’t want to get into specifics but south India is so much better than north India. I know the appeal of india is the colourful mystical chaos of northern states in the places like Varanasi, but southern states are much more welcoming and much better people in general. Any southern city like Hyderabad, Bangalore, Chennai should be the default landing place for foreigners. I am very ashamed of northern states.</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1nk0d2t/trip_report_in_india/nevfbqs/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><div class="md"><p>Uber works really good in India, I understand where you&#39;re coming from, I&#39;m an Indian and have a Vietnamese girlfriend and we also faced the same situation when she came to India, but everything could be avoided by just ignoring anyone who tries to sell you something , scammers are not limited to India specially the taxi one, I&#39;ve faced more scammers in countries like Thailand and Vietnam, that&#39;s just common across any tourist places, I&#39;m not defending Indian scammers though, but just letting you know to be prepared the next time you go somewhere else. Other than that hope everything else worked out great for you.</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1nk0d2t/trip_report_in_india/neucgaf/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p></li></ol></section>]]></description><pubDate>Thu, 18 Sep 2025 11:27:28 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.businesstoday.in/india/story/jaipur-son-kills-mother-after-heated-wifi-argument-father-says-hang-him-494461-2025-09-17</link><title>Jaipur son kills mother after heated WiFi argument, father says 'hang him' (businesstoday.in)</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1nk0bax/jaipur_son_kills_mother_after_heated_wifi/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1nk0bax/jaipur_son_kills_mother_after_heated_wifi/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1nk0bax/jaipur_son_kills_mother_after_heated_wifi/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='separator separator-before-comments'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='comments'><p>Top comments</p><ol><li><div class="md"><p>Father is right tho 🤷🏻‍♀️</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1nk0bax/jaipur_son_kills_mother_after_heated_wifi/neugqs5/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><div class="md"><p>If a Killer kills his mother over WIFI, the problem is not the WIFI it is the Killer.</p><p>If a Killer kills his wife over coffee being cold, the problem is not the cold coffee it is the Killer</p><p>If a Killer kills her husband to runaway with her lover, the problem is not her lover it is the Killer.</p><p>If a rapist rapes a girl, the problem is not the dress she was wearing, it was the Rapist.</p><p><strong>&quot;When society is starting to constantly in fighting because of reading the clickbait news from New organisations,</strong> </p><p><strong>the problem is not the people reading news, but the Money Hungry News organisations who use clickbait titles to get clicks and sell newspapers.&quot;</strong></p><p>Do not encourage clickbait titles, these clickbait tiles are equivalent to ads penis enlargement pills or breast enlargement pills on websites.
