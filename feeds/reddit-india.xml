In its verdict, however, <strong><em>&quot;the Supreme Court stated that the SIT’s “exhaustive investigation” found no violation of the law and asserted that it would not allow tarnishing news reports about the rescue park in Jamnagar, Gujarat&quot;</em></strong>. This decision effectively gave Vantara a clean chit and brought the matter to a definitive close. This decision was perceived by the public as favoring the powerful. [<em>No disrespect to the Rescue park folks and the Supreme Court here this is just my opinion and not a comment on your working or integrity</em>]</p><p><strong>Example 2: The Election CCTV Hearing</strong><br/>In another case, the Haryana and Punjab High Court directed the Election Commission to provide CCTV footage related to the Haryana Assembly elections, following a petition by counsel Mehmood Pracha. Within three days, the government amended the law to prevent public access to electronic documents and recordings connected to elections, justifying the change as a way to “ <em>preventing the misuse of electronic election records. This includes CCTV camera and webcasting footage, as well as video recordings of candidates, during the election process.&quot;</em> Doubling down on this , the retention period for election CCTV footage was also shortened—from 1year to just 45 days, after which the recordings would be deleted. This maneuver effectively rendered the High Court’s verdict meaningless.</p><p>Taken together, these examples suggest that even if Rahul Gandhi were to win his case in the Supreme Court, the government could simply introduce new legislation to block the release of critical data. And if he were to lose, public perception might lean toward suspicion of foul play [ <em>Again, no disrespect is intended toward the Supreme Court—I deeply appreciate its strong stance on issues like the electoral bonds case</em>] .It would also effectively end any further discussion on the matter once the Supreme Court has delivered its judgment.</p><p>As Rahul Gandhi himself emphasized during his press conference, he will just present the facts, and it will ultimately be up to the public and the country’s youth to decide what to do next.</p><p>P.S.
