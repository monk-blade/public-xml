Only one-sided talks? Keeping our farmers, traders, and the employment of youth on the line, the Indian market is being completely opened up for the Americans. If the entire Indian market comes under the control of the Americans, where will our people go?"He further said that such remarks amount to a "surrender" before the United States. </p><p>"Such a surrender in front of Trump is not only fatal for the Indian economy but also an insult to 1.4 billion Indians," Kejriwal added.<span></span>Kejriwal further urged the Prime Minister not to weaken and to protect the honour of the nation.Kejriwal's remarks came amid Prime Minister Narendra Modi's X post on Wednesday, in which he described New Delhi and Washington as "natural partners" and said he was confident about the progress of the negotiations. </p><p>The PM also expressed his willingness to speak to Trump.<span></span>"India and the US are close friends and natural partners. I am confident that our trade negotiations will pave the way for unlocking the limitless potential of the India-US partnership. Our teams are working to conclude these discussions at the earliest. I am also looking forward to speaking with President Trump. We will work together to secure a brighter, more prosperous future for both our people," PM Modi said in the X post.This comes following a statement by Trump on Tuesday (local time) via Truth Social, where he expressed enthusiasm about continuing negotiations to tackle trade barriers between the two nations. He also expressed confidence in reaching a "successful conclusion" and looked forward to speaking with PM Modi in the upcoming weeks.<span></span>"I am pleased to announce that India and the United States of America are continuing negotiations to address the Trade Barriers between our two Nations. </p><p>I look forward to speaking with my very good friend, Prime Minister Modi, in the upcoming weeks. I feel certain that there will be no difficulty in coming to a successful conclusion for both of our Great Countries!" Trump stated in his post.Trump's remark comes days after he called the India-US ties a "very special relationship" and affirmed that he and PM Modi would always be friends, asserting that there is "nothing to worry about".<span></span>New Delhi is facing global uncertainties due to heightened economic tensions following the US imposition of a 50 per cent tariff on Indian imports, including an additional 25 per cent due to its purchase of Russian crude oil, which, according to Washington, fuels Moscow's efforts in its conflict with Ukraine.</p></div><div class="gallery"><p><img src="https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123803978,imgsize-45512,width-400,resizemode-4/123803978.jpg"></p></div></section>]]></description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Sep 2025 16:12:01 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2025/Sep/09/complicit-in-genocide-opposition-parties-condemn-india-signing-trade-agreement-with-israel-amid-war-on-gaza</link><title>'Complicit in genocide': Two opposition parties condemn India signing trade agreement with Israel (newindianexpress.com)</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1nd3efu/complicit_in_genocide_two_opposition_parties/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1nd3efu/complicit_in_genocide_two_opposition_parties/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p>Reading time: 3 min | <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1nd3efu/complicit_in_genocide_two_opposition_parties/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='preview-image'><img src='https://media.newindianexpress.com/newindianexpress%2F2025-09-09%2F1j5oyyx0%2FG0U1mJcWkAALmxc.jpg?w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100' /></section><section class='parsed-content'><p><span>India and Israel signed a Bilateral Investment Agreement in New Delhi on Tuesday.

As expected, not many were happy to see the tweet on the Internet. </p><p>&ldquo;Ro thinks Indian Americans should be on India&rsquo;s side, not America,&rdquo; a user commented on the post. Someone else countered: &ldquo;The Indians you are referring to are speaking out and the ones taking Trump&rsquo;s side on the issue have shown they were only in it for themselves and or for US / India mutual interests.&rdquo;</p><blockquote><p>I am waiting for all those Indian Americans who voted for Trump over Harris &ndash;you know who you are &ndash;to speak out against Trump sabotaging the partnership with blanket tariffs that are harsher than those on China.

In 2019, he became the first Indian-American to join the Congressional Pakistan Caucus, prompting hundreds of organisations with Indian roots to urge him to withdraw from the same. </p><p>Consequently, someone dug up that page of US political history, saying, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like you were ever defending Indian Americans in the first place. You were literally part of the Pakistani Caucus. Trump changed his position on many issues, how can you blame voters for that?&rdquo;</p><p>Yet another user wrote, &ldquo;Trump is bad, but you were no better Ro, in case you really had a change of heart, pls enlighten us, how did it happen?&rdquo; They also plugged a years-old post from 2023, which linked him to Pakistan-born businessman Tahir Javed. </p><p>&ldquo;Why does @RoKhanna badger #India so much? @USIRCOnline uncovered that Ro gets money from Pakistani-American businessman &amp; Democratic Party mega-donor Tahir Javed. Ro visits Javed&rsquo;s condo,&rdquo; the United States-India Relationship Council (USIRC) page on X shared at the time. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s pictured in 2019 talking to Javed while standing w/ Pak PM Imran Khan. Follow the money.&rdquo;</p><p>Someone else not only hit it out against Khanna, but also former Vice President Kamala Harris, and Democrats at large. &ldquo;All of you democrats and republicans are cut out of the same cloth. You are all carry the same dna of political corruption, grift and deception. Pretending to be friends before election and show true colors once in power. Kamala would have done the exact same,&rdquo; a person who claims neither to be a Republican nor a Democrat added to the comments section. </p><h2>Global tariff chaos amid nearly withered India-US ties</h2><p>Ro Khanna&rsquo;s tone in his recent social media past is quite similar to the sentiment raised by Indian-origin<a href="https://www.financialexpress.com/world-news/us-news/india-not-an-adversary-like-china-nikki-haley-predicts-strategic-disaster-for-us-if-rift-continues/3952865/"> Nikki Haley in her August op-ed published on <em>Newsweek</em></a>. At the time, she, too, raised concerns over how Trump&rsquo;s moves were basically threatening a decades-long friendship between consequential democratic nations. </p><p>On one hand, she stood by the US president in urging India&rsquo;s Prime Minister Narendra Modi to pay heed to Trump&rsquo;s warnings and rework the ties with Russia and the purchase of Russian oil. On the other, she emphasised the US needed to treat India as &ldquo;the prized free and democratic partner that it is &ndash; not an adversary like China, which has thus far avoided sanctions for its Russian oil purchases, despite being one of Moscow&rsquo;s&nbsp;largest&nbsp;customers.&rdquo;</p><p>Hailing the South Asian country as &ldquo;only country that can serve as a counterweight to Chinese dominance in Asia,&rdquo; Haley warned that a rift between India and America would ultimately result in a &ldquo;strategic disaster.&rdquo; </p><h2>Trump tariffs: India vs China </h2><p>The US president&rsquo;s new tariff plan that went into effect in August brough duties on Chinese goods to a massive 30%. However, they were still not as high as eye-widening toll on India. After being hit with secondary sanctions, India&rsquo;s suffered a 50% tariff toll. </p><p>Despite China being the biggest buyer of Russian oil, India coming in second, the South Asian nation was subjected to unequal treatment. Even with Russia&rsquo;s war in Ukraine, Trump came out of an inconclusive summit with Putin in Alaska with a smile on his face. Subsequently, White House officials confirmed &ldquo;<a href="https://www.financialexpress.com/world-news/us-news/sanctions-on-india-are-to-put-an-end-to-ukraine-war-white-house-confirms/3951808/?utm_term=Autofeed&amp;utm_medium=Echobox&amp;utm_source=Facebook#Echobox=1755661247">sanctions on India</a>&rdquo; were meant to exert extra pressure on the Russian president to stop the onslaught Ukraine. </p><p>And then, US State Secretary Marco Rubio explained in a separate interview with <em>Fox Business</em> why India was targeted with secondary tariffs while China was spared. </p><p>&ldquo;Well, if you look at the oil that&rsquo;s going to China and being refined, a lot of that is then being sold back into Europe. Europe&rsquo;s also buying natural gas still. Now, there are countries trying to wean themselves off it, but there&rsquo;s more Europe can do with regard to their own sanctions,&rdquo; he said. </p><p>Deeming additional duties on China as a threat to global oil prices, Rubio added, &ldquo;f you put secondary sanctions on a country &ndash; let&rsquo;s say you were to go after the oil sales of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.financialexpress.com/world-news/not-consumers-indias-big-oil-lobby-profiteering-from-russia-india-oil-trade-white-house-trade-advisors-damning-claims/3950977/">Russian oil</a>&nbsp;to China &ndash; well, China just refines that oil. That oil is then sold into the global marketplace, and anyone who&rsquo;s buying that oil would be paying more for it or, if it doesn&rsquo;t exist, would have to find an alternative source for it.&rdquo;</p><p>On the same page, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent accused India of profiting off Russian oil purchases in a different CNBC interview, while labelling China&rsquo;s imports &ldquo;suboptimal.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If you go back to pre 2022, pre invasion (of Ukraine), 13% of China&rsquo;s oil was already coming from Russia. Now it&rsquo;s 16%. so China has diversified input of their oil. India has less than 1% of their oil coming from Russia (before 2022),&rdquo; he claimed during the August interaction. &ldquo;And now I believe it&rsquo;s 42%. India is just profiteering, they are reselling. They made $16 billion in excess profits, some of the richest families in India. So this is a completely different thing.&rdquo;</p><h2>Trump on India&rsquo;s tariffs</h2><p>With 50% tariffs on Indian goods having gone into effect last week, President Trump&rsquo;s latest comments on the global row suggested that India offered to cut its tariffs on US goods to &ldquo;nothing.&rdquo; He wrote online, &ldquo;India buys most of its oil and military products from Russia, very little from the US,&rdquo; adding New Delhi should have reduced the tariffs &ldquo;years ago.&rdquo; </p><p>In his Monday post, he went on to say, &ldquo;What few people understand is that we do very little business with India, but they do a tremendous amount of business with us. In other words, they sell us massive amounts of goods, their biggest &ldquo;client,&rdquo; but we sell them very little &ndash; Until now a totally one sided relationship, and it has been for many decades.&rdquo; </p><p>The MAGA leader&rsquo;s comments aligned with Indian PM Narendra Modi&rsquo;s attendance at the Shanghai Co-Operation Organisation (SCO) summit in Tianjin, China, where apparently had positive interactions with Chinese and Russian president Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin, respectively.</p></div></section>]]></description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Sep 2025 18:57:28 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://theprint.in/opinion/umar-khalid-is-not-an-exception-the-leopards-will-eat-your-face-too/2738785/</link><title>Umar Khalid is not an exception.

You don&rsquo;t need to agree with a single word he has ever spoken. You can also despise his politics entirely. But know that his five-year imprisonment without trial requires your attention. You don&rsquo;t need to defend him to recognise what his treatment says about the state you live under&hellip; and what it will eventually mean for you.</p><p>Last week, the Delhi High Court delivered a 133-page judgment denying bail to Khalid and eight others accused in the 2020 Delhi riots conspiracy case. The length of the document would suggest thorough deliberation, but several experts have pointed out that its contents reveal a troubling departure from basic legal principles. The judgment explicitly dismissed the foundational tenet set by the Supreme Court that &ldquo;bail is the rule and jail is the exception&rdquo;. Last year, the top court had<a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-matters-of-liberty-delay-of-even-one-day-is-a-day-too-many-sc-101726081276371.html"> observed</a>: &ldquo;In matters of liberty, even one day delay is a day too many&hellip; One cannot be deprived of liberty even for a single day. The process should not become punishment.&rdquo;</p><div><p>According to the Delhi High Court, however, five years without trial is not punishment enough. It declared that the bail rule simply doesn&rsquo;t apply to &ldquo;grave&rdquo; offences under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.</p></div></div><div><p>Many journalists and legal scholars have<a href="https://article-14.com/post/how-the-delhi-police-are-disproving-their-own-case-against-political-activist-umar-khalid--622ee2eee1082"> picked apart</a> the allegations against Umar Khalid and the other eight co-accused, which hinge on many flimsy theories. The prosecution alleges that he was part of a &ldquo;deep-rooted&rdquo; conspiracy to orchestrate the 2020 Delhi riots that killed 54 people and damaged over 1,500 properties. Khalid and his co-accused apparently planned a &ldquo;chakka jam&rdquo; (road blockade) through WhatsApp messages and &ldquo;secret meetings&rdquo;, and that this constituted terrorism under UAPA. The JNU scholar allegedly gave speeches criticising the Citizenship Amendment Act, even though<a href="https://x.com/thepeeinghuman/status/1963570816932540813"> the speech</a> in question speaks of a Gandhian approach to protest.</p><p>The charges against the others are even stranger. Gulfisha Fatima organised a women&rsquo;s march. Natasha Narwal and Devangana Kalita participated in protests. All of these are our constitutionally protected rights, yet only some of the accused have been granted bail.</p><p>Meanwhile, the evidence is<a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/delhi-riots-why-uapa-accused-jailed-for-5-yrs-were-denied-bail-10229058/"> strikingly thin</a>. The prosecution relies primarily on WhatsApp chats about protest coordination and testimony from anonymous &ldquo;protected witnesses&rdquo; codenamed &lsquo;Radium&rsquo; and &lsquo;Sodium&rsquo;. These witnesses claim that in secret meetings, there were &ldquo;open discussions regarding escalation of violence and setting parts of Delhi on fire.&rdquo; In essence, the prosecution has built a terrorism case around protest planning, supported by anonymous testimony that cannot be challenged, under a legal standard that presumes guilt rather than innocence.</p><hr><p><em><strong>Also read: </strong><a href="https://theprint.in/opinion/kolkatas-silencing-of-javed-akhtar-exposes-indias-secular-vacuum/2736685/">Kolkata&rsquo;s silencing of Javed Akhtar exposes India&rsquo;s secular vacuum</a><strong><br> </strong></em></p><hr> <h3><b>Making an example</b></h3><p>Constitutional law scholar Gautam Bhatia writes in a blog<a href="https://indconlawphil.wordpress.com/"> titled</a> &ldquo;Five Years Of (A) Life &ndash; I: The Bail Order in the Delhi Riots Cases&rdquo; that the &ldquo;problem for the prosecution, however, was that none of these individuals had publicly called for, or instigated, violence or riots&rdquo;, which means that they had to build their case around the idea of a conspiracy. In circumstantial cases, Bhatia says that a court can do one of two things. &ldquo;Given the drastic consequences of denying bail (years of incarceration), it can adopt an &lsquo;eyes wide open&rsquo; approach, which requires the prosecution&rsquo;s evidence on record to be concrete and specific, and for there to exist a clear link between fact and inference (of guilt). Or it can adopt an &lsquo;eyes wide shut&rsquo; approach, which takes not just the evidence on the record, but the prosecution&rsquo;s inferences from that evidence on face value.&rdquo; This, says Bhatia, is a clear case of the latter.</p><p>But jurisprudence matters very little when the state wants to make an example of you. These incarcerated young men and women are spending the best years of their lives behind bars because they illustrate the message that any dissent can and will be crushed. It&rsquo;s why these young people with little social capital are in jail, and someone like Yogendra Yadav is not. As the psephologist and politician<a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/the-case-of-umar-khalid-and-others-is-a-textbook-example-of-what-justice-is-not-10230898/"> writes</a> in <i>The</i> <i>Indian Express</i>: &ldquo;If Umar is in jail for saying the CAA was anti-Muslim, I should be too. If Khalid is in jail for coordinating local protests against the CAA, I should be too.&rdquo;</p><p>The Delhi High Court&rsquo;s verdict is so extreme that even prominent Right-wing commentators have<a href="https://x.com/Iyervval/status/1963845146744701405"> criticised it</a>. Still, plenty other &ldquo;proud Indians&rdquo; cluelessly cheer it on. But here&rsquo;s what those in favour of this spectacle don&rsquo;t understand: Precedents can rarely be contained. The weapon of repression, once normalised and perfected, becomes available for broader deployment. There&rsquo;s a reason the<a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/leopards-eating-peoples-faces-party"> phrase</a> &ldquo;I never thought leopards would eat MY face&rdquo; is the stuff of internet legend.</p><p>The UAPA has already demonstrated this appetite. The acquittal rate under the act stands at a whopping 97.2 per cent for arrests between 2015 and 2020, but it&rsquo;s a very handy instrument of torture.</p><p>It devoured Stan Swamy, an 83-year-old Jesuit priest with Parkinson&rsquo;s disease, jailed for advocating for Adivasi rights. Swamy was notoriously denied even a straw to drink water. He died in custody in July 2021, murdered by bureaucratic cruelty, never having faced trial. UAPA also consumed GN Saibaba, a wheelchair-bound professor who rotted in prison for a decade before being acquitted and released. He died months after his freedom, destroyed by years of incarceration for crimes that he did not commit. The list goes on: Abdul Wahid Sheikh, a schoolteacher,<a href="https://www.telegraphindia.com/opinion/prisoners-of-conscience-umar-khalid-has-become-the-face-of-moral-resistance/cid/1973463#goog_rewarded"> falsely accused</a> of terrorism in the 2006 Mumbai train blasts. Twelve other men who were charged under MCOCA in the same case and were sentenced to death before being<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy4n4yzpx07o"> acquitted</a> by the Bombay High Court.</p><p>The appetite only grows. After indefinite detention for activists and dissenters, the state is now experimenting with new tools for even elected representatives. A few weeks ago, Parliament passed the 130th Constitutional Amendment Bill, ensuring that ministers will be removed from office if detained for just 30 days in criminal cases. Critics have argued that it&rsquo;s a<a href="https://thewire.in/law/all-that-is-wrong-with-the-130th-constitution-amendment"> complete inversion</a> of the principles of natural justice, and will allow the government a free hand to dispose of, say, opposition CMs.</p><p>Even those who cultivate proximity to power discover that grovelling offers no protection. There is no better example than Ranveer Allahabadia, the influencer who built his brand on interviews with those in authority. His deferential, cotton-candy line of questioning couldn&rsquo;t protect him when the state&rsquo;s machinery decided to rain down. Or take the recent<a href="https://theprint.in/india/bulldozer-now-haunts-bjp-in-uttar-pradesh-party-functionarys-brother-ends-life-after-shop-demolition/2708379/"> suicide</a> in Uttar Pradesh of Chetan Saini, brother of a BJP mandal vice-president. Saini killed himself after his 20-year-old fruit shop was demolished in an &ldquo;anti-encroachment drive.&rdquo; Until then, the bulldozer was a hallowed symbol of &ldquo;justice&rdquo; when used against Muslim homes, and significantly boosted UP CM Adityanath&rsquo;s rankings.</p><hr><p><em><strong>Also read: </strong><a href="https://theprint.in/opinion/vijay-in-tamil-nadu-brand-stalin-uncle-taunt/2736572/">Vijay is winning nickname war in Tamil Nadu.

Across the world, those who cheer authoritarian overreach discover that the bulldozer eventually comes for them, too. In the USA, voters who supported Donald Trump&rsquo;s immigration crackdowns now watch ICE tear through their own families. The promises to deport &ldquo;criminals and gang members&rdquo; have expanded to include anyone with or without proper documentation, including residents with American-born children.</p><p>Trump&rsquo;s policies, in turn, have contributed to a massive anti-Indian sentiment. American racists don&rsquo;t care if Indian-Americans celebrated Trump&rsquo;s tough stance on &ldquo;illegal immigration&rdquo;; they are happy that H-1B visas are now under the radar. In Australia, an Indian immigrant took the<a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/trending/indian-man-heckled-while-speaking-at-anti-immigration-protest-in-australia-i-came-here-for-the-right-reasons-101756961606719.html"> stage</a> at an anti-immigration rally, criticising the government&rsquo;s &ldquo;open door policy&rdquo;. &ldquo;Anyone can come in, claim a spot and demand that Australia change for them.

Whether you will be guilty or innocent when it&rsquo;s your time won&rsquo;t matter either. A state that thinks nothing of extinguishing five years from Umar Khalid&rsquo;s life will not pause to think of you. Its blueprint has been set, the infrastructure is in place, and the public has been trained to look away.

Two workers were fixing a lift in an apartment just a 5 floor building and the lift had water stuck underground since it’s near the park also because the drainage system here is a joke and we all know how Delhi is actually flooded rn. Now anyone with normal common sense would have TURNED OFF THE ELECTRICITY before sending people down there but nope these people didn’t. One poor guy got ELECTROCUTED and died instantly. The other was trapped with him in that lift for more than 3 hours before police and fire brigade could get them out. Imagine being stuck there watching your co worker’s dead body lying next to you for HOURS. And here’s the part that made me rage even more there was NO AMBULANCE. None. Although there were like 3 cars of police , even a fire brigade team, but didn&#39;t even call one ambulance .They just brought a dirty tempo like a small truck shoved the body inside and the surviving guy himself covered his dead friend with a white cloth. Like WHAT THE FUCK. That’s the “respect” they gave him. This is what it means to be a daily wage worker in India. No safety gear no basic precautions no dignity in life or in death. If it was a rich person from that same building the response would have been completely different ambulances doctors news channels everyone. But since it was a worker they just dumped him in a tempo and moved on. Disgusting and heartbreaking.

The details were shared by the Consulate General of India in Jeddah in response to an RTI filed by activist Ajay Basudev Bose from Maharashtra.</p><p>The biggest chunk of the expenditure &mdash; more than &#8377;10.26 crore &mdash; was spent on hotel rentals, while transport arrangements cost another &#8377;4.05 crore. The remaining amount of around &#8377;1.21 crore has not been broken down in the RTI reply.</p><p>&ldquo;What the Consulate has provided shows that the government spent an unusually high amount on just a few hours in Jeddah,&rdquo; Bose told reporters after receiving the response.</p><figure><div><blockquote><p>RTI reply recvd 4m <a href="https://twitter.com/CGIJeddah?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@CGIJeddah</a> on PM Modi visit in April 25 to Saudi Arabia, Total Amount spent,Rs 15Cr,54L,3K,792,but what is Shocking Rs 10Cr,26L,39K,658 spent on Hotel Rental Charges alone, Will anybody Question Modi about this Extravagance <a href="https://twitter.com/narendramodi?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@narendramodi</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/DrSJaishankar?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@DrSJaishankar</a>&hellip; <a href="https://t.co/yrarDUQofQ">pic.twitter.com/yrarDUQofQ</a></p>&mdash; AJAY Basudev Bose (@AjayBos93388306) <a href="https://twitter.com/AjayBos93388306/status/1961263415877669151?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 29, 2025</a></blockquote> </div></figure><p>The Prime Minister was scheduled to be in Saudi Arabia for two days, April 22 and 23. However, after a terror attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir, he cut his trip short and returned to Delhi in less than 12 hours. Modi had landed in Jeddah on the afternoon of April 22 but flew back by the morning of April 23, skipping the official state dinner.</p><p>Critics are questioning why so much money was spent on hotels when, in state visits, the host country is usually responsible for providing accommodation. &ldquo;If the Saudi government was prepared to handle hospitality, why did we spend over ten crore rupees on hotels alone?&rdquo; asked a senior opposition leader.</p><p>When compared with Modi&rsquo;s other foreign trips this year, the Saudi visit stands out as one of the costliest. A four-day trip to France in February cost &#8377;25.59 crore, which averages to about &#8377;6.40 crore per day. A one-day visit to the United States cost &#8377;16.54 crore, while a one-day Thailand trip cost &#8377;4.92 crore. In comparison, Modi&rsquo;s brief stay of just over 12 hours in Saudi Arabia cost &#8377;15.54 crore, making it the second most expensive foreign visit of 2025 so far.</p><figure><div><blockquote><div><p>Vote Chor Narendra Modi spent 15.54 Cr on his two trip to Saudi Arabia.</p><p>Hotel rentals alone is 10.26 Cr.

Here is my story.  It is a long one, so, if you wanna read it takes  take your seat. Hope I can find some real help here. At least this is the purpose of this post.</p><p>Im Russian guy, 26 yo, I am from Ukraine border myself originally (Taganrog,  Rostov region. It is 20km away from the Ukraine,  you can google map it if u like), and I came to India in the beginning of the war, for safety reasons. Got a student visa, to study yoga and vedic culture, and its extendable, I extended once but couldnt do it second time (there was a whole another long story. But I did not intentionally overstay here, cause I obviously didn&#39;t want to break immigration laws). So visa started to expire, then started to overstay. I didnt go back that time cause of low income (spent last everything just to relocate to India, cause was afraid of draft.)and because of forceful drafts that were going on that time (late 2022). So I had to live there, in WB, with no valid visa for a while. Again, its not thatbi wanted to overstay, I just could not prolong it. There was, unfortunately, a reason for it.</p><p>Then, on top of all that I lost my passport and documents. I got robbed basically, and whole backpack with all my docs, my military certificate, my old phone, was gone. I had to come to delhi for seeking help from my embassy. </p><p>I came to Delhi months and MONTHS ago to get help from my embassy, but they are not VERY much helpful. (Cant expect much from Russian govt structures, if they send their own citizens to fight and die in Ukraine only for their political and economic interests.)</p><p>My embassy is KIND OF helping me, but only by giving me a temporary flight document. They dont provide neither place to stay, nor flight tickets eventhough they understand that I have no support from neither my family members, nor from old friends or anything. My own mom was informed as soon as my passport got stolen, and we asked her to send money for flight tickets and for paying my fine to frro (i didnt have money that moment. I was selling books and was only getting enough money to get by) , but she refused, although she had money. She hung up the phone on me, saying that she &quot;loves me&quot;, although she was informed that i may get into serious difficulties without her urgent help. I never talked to noone from my family eversince... I always had bad relationships w them, but now i just feel as if I have no family. Anyways... </p><p>I&#39;m stuck mostly because of insufficient funds and second reason is that I need to get a paper from FRRO (foreign regional registration office, or Indian bureau of immigration) called exit permit to be able to flight back. They are not giving it to me for months now. &quot;Your case is difficult&quot; , they say.</p><p>One reason for it also is that I cannot give them any residence proof document, (called C form). And that is because I literally cannot rent ANY place whatsoever. I had to live in the railway station, in the waiting area for so long that it just drove me crazy. I lost hell lot of my weight and nervous cells there. They allowed me to stay there cause i explained to local that no hostels, hotels, or landlords allow me without passport. And papers from my embassy are not working at all on them. So its a vicious circle.</p><p>At the end, when one member of their staff (just a cleaner guy) stabbed me there in the arm during the fight (he picked it), police of that new delhi railway station, pf1, just decided to throw me away because I wanted to file an FIR ( that could convince my russian embassy to finally help me with something). They didnt want to fire that guy who stabbed me, and didnt want any trouble or any scandal, so they just kicked me out. so i had to just roam around, from 1 place to another, for months after that. This is my situation even now. </p><p>Embassy guys did look concerned when they saw me with my arm bleeding but couldnt do much still. They do not provide neither place to stay, nor, again, are very active in helping me to return back. I mean, they do whatever is there in the script of their job, and I can see that its NOT that much. :/</p><p>So, back to the exit permit... I have no passport and visa to rent any flat or room or hotel or hostel, and I need a document from the house/hostel owner, and without that document I cannot get exit permit feom FRRO🤦‍♂️. At least I cannot get it easily. That may be one of the main reasons why they take way too long in my case. I explained all of it to them ofc, and 1 worker there seemed to be understanding my situation and she offered me some way that MAY work even in the absence of C form, but she was the only 1 in the whole structure who really were getting me and understanding my situation. So its going extremely slow and dull. </p><p>Now I am in the process of getting that exit permit, but it takes extremely long. I may have a chance of getting it still, I believe I just need to push them more, like, make some final push, so to speak, but I have very difficult time doing it while I am having to just always be in a constant search for place to stay, food, medicines and other bare necessities. I was hosted by few indians here in delhi, but noone can do it for long time, which is understandable. Still I need a place to stay for at least 1 or 2 months, to finalise my docs and be ready for a flight. </p><p>Last time I got some nice place i was hosted by a guy from Meghalaya, but he had to fly to his hometown for his uni studies. And I am in the IGIA airport, in the waiting room for last 4 days as Im writing this. I have no money, and only survive here cause that guy from Meghalaya sends me something for water and some food. Rn I have 2 rs in the pocket. Couldn&#39;t contact him this evening.</p><p>Really, really hope to get some support here on reddit. At least i should try anything I can. Im a real person and this story is too. You can come meet me in IGIA in waiting area, to get to know me closer, or write me here, or by links in my profile. Even you can call my russian embassy and ask them if they know me (I&#39;ll give you my name), everyone will surely recognise me. From the phone operator up to the head of the embassy, i think. </p><p>So why im writing here... Im trying to find some host here, even for a few days or a week, or cpl weeks. or, better, to find someone who can help me get any kind of flat, at least for 1 2 months. I need help to finalise my document shit and get back to my country. Any help with getting </p><p>Please reach out to me if something can be done. </p><p>P.s. yes, I tried gurdwaras. They ask for document and the only thing free there is a place on the balcony (on the street basically) and a mat. I tried living in temple too, cant do it no more. What else... yes, NGOs are also asking for documents, however paradoxal it may sound, and don&#39;t allow a foreigner w no documents in. Yes, I filed a lost report about my documents and all. No, police does not help, I spoke with too many of them. No, I cannot just get a job here (without documents) , and I don&#39;t want to be engaged in scamming or drug dealing. If there would be some other option which would work, id accept it. Didnt see any so far. </p><p>So this is my only option rn - simply ask for help in resolving this. I am posting and writing everyone I can in my insta, in my contact list and so on - but no response at all. </p><p>Pray and Hope this message finds someone who really would care. 🙏 </p><p>Thank you for your attention.

That is why I feel it is my duty to share the truth with you about what is really happening here.</p><p>You may have seen headlines claiming that Nepal is facing <strong>“mass protests led by Gen Z against social media ban.”</strong>That is only a half-truth.</p><p><strong>Here is the real sequence of events:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Three days ago, the Nepal government suddenly banned 26 social media platforms including Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, YouTube, and Reddit.</p></li><li><p>They claimed it was about registration and taxes. But these companies are already registered and paying taxes. The real motive is censorship: giving the government power to control online information, delete posts critical of them within 24 hours, and jail those who speak up.</p></li><li><p>In the next two days, criticism exploded across the country. A date was set—September 8—for nationwide protests. But it was never just about social media. That ban was only the spark.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Our patience had already run out.</strong></p><p>Soon, the “<strong>Nepo Babies</strong>” trend erupted in Nepal. It exposed the lavish lifestyles of politicians’ children—designer (clothes,bags, watches, attire )worth lakhs, luxury cars, million-rupee homes, weekly international flights, and even private jets—while ordinary Nepalis struggle daily for survival. Our PM has a salary less than 65k INR but what is owns is in million of $$$.</p><blockquote><p>This hit a nerve. Because Nepal has been under one form of tyranny or another for decades. From monarchy to so-called democracy, corruption and instability have never left us. Not a single prime minister has completed a full term in over 20 years.</p></blockquote><p>[The protests were organized in the name of Gen Z, but they welcomed everyone. We were not just protesting a social media ban. We were standing against corruption, nepotism, tyranny, suppression, and decades of betrayal. In a country of just 30 million people, every single day around 5,000 youths leave to work abroad because there are no jobs, no decent pay, and no basic livelihood at home.]</p><p>And then the tragedy struck. Today, during the protest, I witnessed &amp; carried something I will never forget. A 15-year-old schoolboy, still in uniform, was shot in the head by security forces—acting on orders from a minister. He was not the only one. Reports say more than 20 people have been killed, thousands injured, and the true numbers are being hidden.</p><p>I came home with blood still on my hands, only to see Indian news channels spinning a completely false narrative. They claimed it was all about social media and mocked our youths as being “<strong>addicted</strong>” to it. That angered me, but it didn’t surprise me. I know how the media can twist things.</p><p>That is why I am writing this here, to let you know the truth from the ground.</p><p>🙏</p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section>]]></description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Sep 2025 19:36:32 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2025/9/8/india-expands-censorship-powers-lets-lower-officials-demand-takedowns</link><title>India expands censorship powers, lets lower officials demand takedowns (aljazeera.com)</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1nbom2r/india_expands_censorship_powers_lets_lower/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1nbom2r/india_expands_censorship_powers_lets_lower/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p>Reading time: 11 min | <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1nbom2r/india_expands_censorship_powers_lets_lower/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='preview-image'><img src='https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-12-02T100302Z_1405848618_RC2WW6A8Z1J5_RTRMADP_3_YEAR-END-2024-PHOTOS-BEST-1735309172.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440' /></section><section class='parsed-content'><div><p><strong>New Delhi, India </strong>&mdash; On February 15, thousands of men, women and children scrambled to board trains at New Delhi railway station, bound for the pilgrimage city of Prayagraj, which was playing host to the Kumbh Mela festival, one of Hinduism&rsquo;s holiest gatherings.</p><p>A deadly stampede followed, and 18 people died.</p><p>Yet, in the aftermath, India&rsquo;s Ministry of Railways did not only focus on rescue efforts, investigations into crowd management and compensation for families of victims. It had another concern, too: fighting social media posts that criticised the government over the incident.</p><p>The ministry used a government platform known as Sahyog to issue notices to a range of social media companies, including Meta and Google, which owns YouTube, demanding they pull down posts that the Indian government deemed detrimental to law and order.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Most platforms complied: the government has threatened that those who do not, risk losing what is known as their &ldquo;intermediary immunity&rdquo; status, which shields them from legal liability for the content posted on their sites.</p><p>Until late last year, such takedown notices were issued solely by two federal ministries: the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (IT), and the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (I&amp;B).</p><p>But in October 2024, the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the Sahyog platform, extending the power to issue takedown demands to all federal and state government agencies, and even district-level officials and the police.</p><p>Since then, officers at these multiple levels of government and bureaucracy have sought the removal of content from 3,465 URLs in India, in nearly 300 demands they have submitted through Sahyog, data obtained by Al Jazeera through the country&rsquo;s Right to Information Act reveals.</p><p>It is early days, and these numbers are not yet huge, but analysts say they point to how the tentacles of India&rsquo;s censorship apparatus are spreading deeper, at a time when the country is already facing growing questions over its alleged crackdown on public speech.</p><p>Al Jazeera sought responses from the IT and I&amp;B ministries to allegations of deepening censorship, but has not yet received a response.</p><figure><img src="https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2025-02-13T193151Z_1097822129_RC2VTCA3B865_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-MUSK-1739480737.jpg?resize=770%2C626quality=80" alt="Musk"><figcaption>Tech billionaire Elon Musk meets Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in Washington, DC, US, on February 13, 2025 [@narendramodi/X via Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2>Inside expanding online censorship</h2><p>Historically, officials at the IT and I&amp;B ministries have relied on Section 69a of the Information Technology Act, 2000, to demand that social platforms pull down content.</p><p>Section 69a authorises the government to block public access to any online information, citing the country&rsquo;s sovereignty, security, public order, or similar grounds, by issuing takedown orders to intermediary companies.</p><p>The government has drawn mounting criticism in recent years for a lack of transparency in issuing takedown orders, and has been challenged repeatedly in court. In two judgements &ndash; in 2015 and 2020 &ndash; the Supreme Court of India upheld the constitutionality of Section 69a, but stressed that blocking orders must be narrowly tailored, subject to procedural safeguards, and not used to impose blanket restrictions.</p><p>With Sahyog, the Modi government has turned to a new legal provision: Section 79 of the IT Act.</p><p>The new platform operates under Section 79(3)(b), which states that intermediaries (tech companies) would lose immunity if they fail to remove unlawful content upon government notification.</p><p>Tech policy observers and lawyers point out that since this provision has not yet been reviewed by courts, using it allows the government to completely circumvent the safeguards established by the Supreme Court for Section 69a.</p><p>The government has made it mandatory for all social media platforms to join Sahyog and appoint an employee tasked with acting on demands for takedowns. So far, at least 72 companies have onboarded the centralised government platform, including Meta&rsquo;s WhatsApp and Instagram, Apple, LinkedIn, Google, Telegram, and Snapchat, said Manish Garg, the director of the Indian Cybercrime Coordination Centre (I4C), a body under India&rsquo;s Ministry of Home Affairs.</p><p>A team of I4C officials manages the Sahyog platform, Garg replied in a Right to Information request to Al Jazeera.</p><p>But X, owned by Elon Musk, the world&rsquo;s richest man, has not joined the platform, and has instead taken the Modi government to court in a lawsuit that fiercely argues that Sahyog is a &ldquo;censorship portal&rdquo; and that the Indian administration is clamping down on freedom of speech.</p><p>&ldquo;Despite [court&rsquo;s directions] that the &lsquo;power to block for access by the public can be exercised only in exceptional circumstances&rsquo; under Section 69a with checks and balances, [the government] enabled countless executive officers and police to use Section 79(3)(b) freely and routinely to restrict speech with no checks and balances,&rdquo; X has said in its court filings.</p><p>&ldquo;Thousands of unnamed officers are empowered to unilaterally decide that information is &lsquo;unlawful&rsquo; and block it in all of India,&rdquo; X argues.</p><p>Still, even though X has not joined Sahyog, government agencies send the company requests for takedowns through the platform. Often, the demand has nothing to do with perceived national security concerns.</p><p>In April this year, a district-level police officer in the eastern Indian state of Bihar issued a notice to X seeking the removal of posts from a man who had alleged corruption by a local official.</p><p>The X user whose post drew the takedown order was not informed, until Al Jazeera reached out to him for comment in September. His name is being withheld on his request. X did not act on the demand, and the post is still up.</p><p>Musk&rsquo;s platform, though, is an outlier.</p><p>Mishi Choudhary, a technology lawyer and founder of the New Delhi-based Software Freedom Law Center (SFLC), said that the name Sahyog (Hindi for &ldquo;collaboration&rdquo;) &ldquo;itself gives away what has been happening for years: close coordination between executive and platforms, who have become complicit in ensuring that censorship works well while parroting free speech rhetoric worldwide&rdquo;.</p><p>The new platform is simply the latest move by the Modi government to expand censorship powers, she said. &ldquo;Appointing police officers results in unbridled discretion and opens the door to unchecked censorship,&rdquo; Choudhary told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Like X, the SFLC has also challenged Sahyog&rsquo;s constitutionality in the Delhi High Court.</p><figure><img src="https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AFP__20250511__46964H8__v1__HighRes__IndiaPakistanKashmirUnrest-1746954567.jpg?resize=770%2C513quality=80" alt="ndian paramilitary soldiers inspect a resident in Srinagar on May 11, 2025."><figcaption>Indian paramilitary soldiers inspect a resident in Srinagar on May 11, 2025 [Sajjad Hussain/AFP]</figcaption></figure><h2>Kashmir hostilities worsen woes</h2><p>Since Modi came to power in 2014, takedown orders issued by the Indian government were on the rise even before the introduction of Sahyog. By 2022, the orders rose 14-fold &ndash; from 471 in 2014 to 6,775 in 2022.</p><p>These were demands made by the Indian government under Section 69a. Data after 2022 has been denied under the Right to Information Act. Al Jazeera&rsquo;s request in July this year was rejected, citing a national security exemption.</p><p>But while the Supreme Court has ruled on &ndash; and laid down rules for the use of &ndash; Section 69a, there are no safeguards in place for the use of Section 79, pointed out Tanmay Singh, a lawyer at the Supreme Court, who has previously worked on several censorship-related cases.</p><p>And that is the provision that Sahyog relies on &ndash; opening up a parallel censorship mechanism, even as the government has continued to use Section 69a, too.</p><p>Since Sahyog became operational in October last year, through June this year, different government agencies issued 294 takedown requests. In the last three months of 2024, there were 25 takedown orders issued through the Sahyog platform, including 87 URLs. In the six months this year, until June, the numbers rose by 269 more takedown orders, including 3,276 URLs.</p><p>Orders under both mechanisms &ndash; Sections 69a and 79 &ndash; are alike, and spelled alike, citing similar laws. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like having two different types of cooking pans. A deeper one for broths and a shallow one for stir fry,&rdquo; said a lawyer engaged in the ongoing lawsuit between X and the Modi government.</p><p>&ldquo;You can use both to cook interchangeably as well, but it&rsquo;s based on your convenience.&rdquo;</p><p>The use of both provisions rose in the aftermath of the heightened tensions between India and Pakistan in April and May, after an attack in Indian-administered Kashmir killed 26 civilians.</p><p>New Delhi targeted online platforms and social media accounts linked to Pakistan and ordered a widespread takedown and blocking of accounts &ndash; several of them of Pakistani journalists, news outlets and celebrities &ndash; across all major social media platforms.</p><p>Alongside them were several prominent Indian journalists and international news outlets, including Reuters. On May 8, Aslah Kayyalakkath, the editor-in-chief at Maktoob, an independent news outlet in India focused on communities marginalised in the face of rising Hindu nationalism, was informed by one of his readers that their account on X was inaccessible in India.</p><p>&ldquo;We remain completely in the dark about the reasons behind the move, as no one has informed us or offered any explanation about the specific content that triggered this action,&rdquo; Kayyalakkath told Al Jazeera.</p><p>In a statement on May 8, X said the company has received executive orders from the Indian government to block more than 8,000 accounts in India, or face significant fines and imprisonment of the company&rsquo;s local employees.</p><p>&ldquo;The orders include demands to block access in India to accounts belonging to international news organizations and prominent X users,&rdquo; the company said, adding that in most cases, the Indian government did not specify any evidence or justification to block the accounts.</p><p>Anuradha Bhasin, the managing editor of the daily Kashmir Times, was in the US when her account was blocked in India. She read the news but only realised the ban included her when a friend in India confirmed it.</p><p>&ldquo;These blocking orders of de-platforming content, of blocking news websites, are becoming more and more brazen and common,&rdquo; Bhasin told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Last month, the Indian government banned 25 books in Indian-administered Kashmir, saying that works like those by Booker Prize-winning writer Arundhati Roy propagated &ldquo;false narratives&rdquo; and &ldquo;secessionism&rdquo; in the contested Muslim-majority region. It included Bhasin&rsquo;s A Dismantled State: The Untold Story of Kashmir After Article 370.</p><p>While Bhasin and Kayyalakkath were targeted under Section 69a, the government also ramped up its use of the Sahyog platform amid the crisis with Pakistan. Since the platform&rsquo;s launch, and until April 8, different government bodies issued 130 takedown orders through Sahyog.</p><p>In less than three months after that, until June 30, another 164 orders were issued.</p><figure><img src="https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/33QG7DC-highres-1691040236.jpg?resize=770%2C514quality=80" alt="X logo"><figcaption>The Twitter logo rebranded as X and the old bird logo reflected in smartphone screens, in Paris on July 27, 2023 [Joel Saget/AFP]</figcaption></figure><h2>&lsquo;No sense of humour&rsquo;</h2><p>While Sahyog is the brainchild of the Modi government, X&rsquo;s court filings show how the police in opposition-governed states, like West Bengal and Tamil Nadu, have also leveraged the model&rsquo;s expansive nature.</p><p>Koustav Bagchi, a lawyer at Calcutta High Court and a spokesperson of Modi&rsquo;s Bharatiya Janata Party, is a critic of the state government, governed by West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee of the Trinamool Congress.</p><p>Bagchi often takes digs at her, and in one instance in March, he posted an image on X that depicted Banerjee in an astronaut suit. He was mocking the chief minister over comments she had made earlier, suggesting that Sunita Williams, an Indian-origin NASA astronaut, be given India&rsquo;s highest civilian honour. The state police ordered the blocking of the post, citing &ldquo;risks to public safety and national security&rdquo;.</p><p>X did not act on the demand. &ldquo;I was not aware of this until I was called by a reporter for this two months ago,&rdquo; Bagchi told Al Jazeera. &ldquo;The government just doesn&rsquo;t have any sense of humour. What else is there to say?&rdquo;</p></div></section>]]></description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Sep 2025 19:33:48 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1nbm5u2/my_opinion_on_growing_hate_towards_indians/</link><title>My Opinion on growing hate towards INDIANS</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1nbm5u2/my_opinion_on_growing_hate_towards_indians/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1nbm5u2/my_opinion_on_growing_hate_towards_indians/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p>Reading time: 3 min | <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1nbm5u2/my_opinion_on_growing_hate_towards_indians/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='separator separator-after-permalink'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='selftext'><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>A fellow Bihari here from Siwan district. My village and district played a very significant role in India’s independence. Many top freedom fighters and INC leaders came from my area people who rose above caste and religion to join the freedom struggle. One of them later became the first President of independent India yes, I am talking about Dr. Rajendra Prasad. My own great-grandfather served in the Indian National Army led by Subhash Chandra Bose, and he was jailed in Burma in his last years of service. There were so many freedom fighters and leaders that if I start talking about all of them, this whole conversation would turn into that topic.</p><p>You might be wondering why I am telling you this. Because exactly six months ago a trend started on the &quot;INDIAN&quot; internet with slogans like &quot;Delete Bihar from India&quot;, &quot;Give Bihar to China and take Kashmir&quot;, &quot;Ek Bihari 100 B!m@ari&quot;, &quot;Biharis are B!m@ris&quot;, &quot;Biharis Don&#39;t have Civic sense&quot;, and so on. At that time I sank into such deep depression that I could not even talk about it. Shaming an entire community because of one or two incidents that’s a brilliant thing to do for us &quot;INDIANS&quot;. I was wondering: did our freedom fighters free India for us to see days like this? Did our state somehow fail in the independence movement? Did we play a smaller role than others? Yes, I admit there are faults in our state, but my state was not always like this. Manipulative politics and caste politics have damaged it. I agree that issues like migration, education, and unemployment exist in my state; these issues are being raised today and work is being done on them.</p><p>But the kind of hate I saw for my state back then was just insane. To be honest, at that time I didn’t even feel Indian.</p><p>I had been waiting for days like these… The same kind of hate that &quot;INDIANS&quot; gave to a part of their own country or to a community, today foreigners are giving the same or even more to &quot;INDIANS&quot;. To be frank, I now feel ashamed to defend my country, and I don’t want to. The anti-Indian immigration movements in Australia and other countries show that what Bihar is to India is what India is to the world. Those who have never been abroad and live only in an echo chamber screaming &quot;Ayye Bihari...&quot; in cities like Delhi and Mumbai while thinking themselves superior may not realize how much hatred Indians face overseas. Just as Indians show hatred toward Biharis, foreigners show even more hatred toward Indians and that has been going on for a long time. What looks like harassment and rage-baiting on the internet is, on the ground, horrific racism and discrimination against Indians. Those who consider themselves superior should read how European powers discriminated against INDIANS before independence.</p><p>When we are not even united among ourselves, someone else will take advantage of it, won’t they? When foreigners call us &quot;P@jeet&quot;, do they check whether you are Dravidian, North Indian, Marathi, or Bengali? My question is to you:</p><p>If an Indian is attacked abroad today, will you defend them after checking their region? Over to you.</p><p>Jai Hind!</p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section>]]></description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Sep 2025 17:48:19 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1nblnic/living_in_india_is_just_exhausting_honestly/</link><title>Living in india is just exhausting honestly.</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1nblnic/living_in_india_is_just_exhausting_honestly/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1nblnic/living_in_india_is_just_exhausting_honestly/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p>Reading time: 2 min | <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1nblnic/living_in_india_is_just_exhausting_honestly/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='separator separator-after-permalink'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='selftext'><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Where do I even begin.
