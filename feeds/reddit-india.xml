Earlier in the day, Gandhi gave a PowerPoint presentation and provided documents. He claimed that this was proof of large-scale voter fraud by the BJP and the Election Commission.</p><p>&ldquo;While the Election Commission of India is functioning without bias, Rahul Gandhi is busy weakening democracy, misleading citizens, and trying to create a situation like Bangladesh and Nepal,&rdquo; Thakur said, accusing the Congress leader of undermining democratic institutions.</p><p>Thakur countered Gandhi&rsquo;s Karnataka example, saying: &ldquo;According to records, the Aland Assembly seat was won by the Congress candidate in 2023 with a margin of 10,348 votes. So, Mr Rahul Gandhi, did Congress win that seat through vote chori? Today Rahul Gandhi himself admitted something in his own words &mdash; it was like dropping a hydrogen bomb on himself. He said, &lsquo;I have not come to save democracy.&rsquo; Is he preparing to destroy democracy?&rdquo;</p><p>Taking a dig at Gandhi&rsquo;s repeated defeats, Thakur said that the Congress MP from Wayanad is getting frustrated day-by-day. He added that Rahul Gandhi has become habitual of making false and baseless statements.</p><p>&ldquo;The Congress has lost approximately 90 elections under the leadership of Rahul Gandhi. His frustration is increasing day-by-day... It has become a habit of Rahul Gandhi to make incorrect and baseless allegations. Seeking apology and being reprimanded by the courts have become a routine of Rahul Gandhi.&rdquo;</p><p>He mocked Gandhi&rsquo;s dramatic warning of a &ldquo;hydrogen bomb,&rdquo; saying the much-hyped expos&eacute; fizzled out: &ldquo;While he promised a hydrogen bomb, he came only with firecrackers.&rdquo;</p><p>At the presser, Gandhi alleged that voter lists were being manipulated through software and fraudulent applications, with minorities being deliberately targeted. He cited examples from Karnataka&rsquo;s Aland constituency, claiming that over 6,000 names had been deleted using phone numbers linked to people outside the state.</p><p>He further accused the poll body and Chief Election Commissioner Gyanesh Kumar of presiding over a &ldquo;systematic, mass deletion of voters&rdquo; in Congress-dominated pockets ahead of the 2023 Karnataka assembly polls.</p><p>The Election Commission, however, brushed off the claims, calling them &ldquo;incorrect and baseless.&rdquo; Officials clarified that voter deletions cannot be carried out online by the public and that no removal from the rolls takes place without notifying the individual concerned and giving them a chance to respond.</p></div><div><p><span>Published on: Sep 18, 2025 3:25 PM IST</span> </p></div></div></section>]]></description><pubDate>Thu, 18 Sep 2025 18:12:54 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1nk5qu9/to_anyone_wondering_why_rahul_gandhi_is_not/</link><title>To anyone wondering why Rahul Gandhi is not taking the Vote Chori allegation to Supreme Court here is why</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1nk5qu9/to_anyone_wondering_why_rahul_gandhi_is_not/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1nk5qu9/to_anyone_wondering_why_rahul_gandhi_is_not/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p>Reading time: 2 min | <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1nk5qu9/to_anyone_wondering_why_rahul_gandhi_is_not/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='separator separator-after-permalink'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='selftext'><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>These two examples show why taking a matter to the Supreme Court is a no-win situation.</p><p><strong>Example 1: The Vantara Verdict</strong><br/>Two written applications were submitted to the courts, alleging that Vantara was unlawfully acquiring animals and mistreating them in captivity. In its verdict, however, <strong><em>&quot;the Supreme Court stated that the SIT’s “exhaustive investigation” found no violation of the law and asserted that it would not allow tarnishing news reports about the rescue park in Jamnagar, Gujarat&quot;</em></strong>. This decision effectively gave Vantara a clean chit and brought the matter to a definitive close. This decision was perceived by the public as favoring the powerful. [<em>No disrespect to the Rescue park folks and the Supreme Court here this is just my opinion and not a comment on your working or integrity</em>]</p><p><strong>Example 2: The Election CCTV Hearing</strong><br/>In another case, the Haryana and Punjab High Court directed the Election Commission to provide CCTV footage related to the Haryana Assembly elections, following a petition by counsel Mehmood Pracha. Within three days, the government amended the law to prevent public access to electronic documents and recordings connected to elections, justifying the change as a way to “ <em>preventing the misuse of electronic election records. This includes CCTV camera and webcasting footage, as well as video recordings of candidates, during the election process.&quot;</em> Doubling down on this , the retention period for election CCTV footage was also shortened—from 1year to just 45 days, after which the recordings would be deleted. This maneuver effectively rendered the High Court’s verdict meaningless.</p><p>Taken together, these examples suggest that even if Rahul Gandhi were to win his case in the Supreme Court, the government could simply introduce new legislation to block the release of critical data. And if he were to lose, public perception might lean toward suspicion of foul play [ <em>Again, no disrespect is intended toward the Supreme Court—I deeply appreciate its strong stance on issues like the electoral bonds case</em>] .It would also effectively end any further discussion on the matter once the Supreme Court has delivered its judgment.</p><p>As Rahul Gandhi himself emphasized during his press conference, he will just present the facts, and it will ultimately be up to the public and the country’s youth to decide what to do next.</p><p>P.S. I did use ChatGPT to make the post more understandable</p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section>]]></description><pubDate>Thu, 18 Sep 2025 17:01:29 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/trump-names-afghanistan-india-china-pakistan-among-major-drug-transit-illicit-drug-producing-countries/article70064066.ece</link><title>Trump names Afghanistan, India, China, Pakistan among major drug transit, illicit drug producing countries (thehindu.com)</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1nk23uw/trump_names_afghanistan_india_china_pakistan/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1nk23uw/trump_names_afghanistan_india_china_pakistan/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p>Reading time: 4 min | <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1nk23uw/trump_names_afghanistan_india_china_pakistan/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='preview-image'><img src='https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/q5dik3/article70064079.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/2025-09-16T164503Z_1708444932_RC24BFAG57UT_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP.JPG' /></section><section class='parsed-content'><div><p>President Donald Trump has named China, Afghanistan, India and Pakistan among 23 major drug transit or major illicit drug producing countries, saying that by manufacturing and trafficking illicit drugs and precursor chemicals, these nations are threatening the safety of the U.S. and its citizens.</p><p>In a &lsquo;Presidential Determination&rsquo; submitted to Congress on Monday (September 15, 2025), Mr. Trump said he has identified 23 countries as &ldquo;major drug transit or major illicit drug producing&rdquo; nations.</p><p>These nations are Afghanistan, The Bahamas, Belize, Bolivia, Burma, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, India, Jamaica, Laos, Mexico, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Panama, Peru, and Venezuela.</p><p>Mr. Trump delivered the &ldquo;Major&rsquo;s List&rdquo; to Congress, designating these countries as responsible for sourcing and transporting illicit drugs into the U.S., the White House said.</p><p>The State Department announced the Presidential Determination of these 23 countries, with five countries &mdash; Afghanistan, Bolivia, Burma, Colombia, and Venezuela &mdash; listed as having &ldquo;failed demonstrably to make substantial efforts,&rdquo; calling upon them to improve their counternarcotics efforts.</p><div></div><p>By manufacturing and trafficking illicit drugs and precursor chemicals, these countries are threatening the safety of the United States and its citizens, the State Department said in a statement.</p><p>The State Department clarified that a country's presence on the list does not necessarily reflect its government's counterdrug efforts or level of cooperation with the United States.</p><p>The listing is based on "the combination of geographic, commercial, and economic factors that allow drugs or precursor chemicals to be transited or produced, even if a government has engaged in robust and diligent narcotics control and law enforcement measures,&rdquo; it said.</p><p>Mr. Trump said Afghanistan, Bolivia, Burma, Colombia, and Venezuela have failed &ldquo;demonstrably&rdquo; during the previous 12 months to both adhere to their obligations under international counternarcotics agreements and to take the relevant measures to combat the threat.</p><p>On China, Mr. Trump said the country's role as the "world's largest source&rdquo; of precursor chemicals fuelling illicit fentanyl production has been well documented.</p><p>Mr. Trump also said that China is also a major supplier fuelling global epidemics of other synthetic narcotics, including nitazenes and methamphetamine.</p><p>The Chinese leadership &ldquo;can and must take stronger and sustained action to cut down these chemical flows and prosecute the drug criminals facilitating them.&rdquo; </p><p>On Afghanistan, Mr. Trump said that despite the Taliban's announced ban on illegal drugs, drug stockpiles and ongoing production &mdash; including expanding production of methamphetamine &mdash; have sustained the flow of drugs to international markets.</p><p>"Revenue from this drug trade funds transnational criminal groups and supports international terrorists.

Speaking at the India Today South Conclave, he argued that nearly 50% of a property&rsquo;s cost goes straight to government taxes and charges, leaving little room for affordability.</p><div><h4>Related Articles</h4></div><p>&ldquo;Government only takes away nearly 50% through the taxes on the property. So they need to first fix that,&rdquo; Dutt said, pointing to the many hidden levies stacked on top of GST.</p><p>While GST on under-construction affordable housing is just 1%, and 5% on other residential properties, that&rsquo;s only the beginning. Buyers also pay stamp duty (5&ndash;8%), registration charges, municipal fees, development cesses, and premiums for extra floor area. Industry estimates confirm that, once land premiums, approvals, compliance, and infrastructure charges are added in, the government&rsquo;s share can climb to 30&ndash;50% of project costs in urban markets.</p><p>Dutt also flagged land as a crippling factor, often accounting for 50&ndash;85% of project costs in metros. He said government bodies like the Railways, Defense, Port Trusts, and municipal corporations hold vast tracts of unused land that could be unlocked for housing. &ldquo;They need to monetize and unlock those, make land cheaper for affordable housing, and then allow private developers to build under tax benefits,&rdquo; he urged.</p><p>But high taxes and expensive land aren&rsquo;t the only issues. Financing remains costly, and infrastructure often fails to keep pace. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the point of going 50 km from the city and doing affordable homes when people can&rsquo;t commute?&rdquo; Dutt asked.</p><p>Despite tax benefits for developers, Dutt said the mismatch persists: capital remains expensive, land is scarce, and urban transport and roads are inadequate. The result is that affordable housing schemes stall or get pushed far from where people actually work.</p><p>With buyers shouldering nearly half their property cost in government-related fees and developers squeezed by high land and capital costs, Dutt&rsquo;s message was blunt: until land is unlocked and taxes rationalized, affordable housing will remain out of reach.</p></div><div><p><span>Published on: Sep 17, 2025 9:27 AM IST</span> </p></div></div></section>]]></description><pubDate>Thu, 18 Sep 2025 07:15:15 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1njd6gx/perspective_of_a_corporate_job_indian_muslim/</link><title>Perspective of a corporate job Indian Muslim, surviving India</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1njd6gx/perspective_of_a_corporate_job_indian_muslim/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1njd6gx/perspective_of_a_corporate_job_indian_muslim/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p>Reading time: 3 min | <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1njd6gx/perspective_of_a_corporate_job_indian_muslim/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='separator separator-after-permalink'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='selftext'><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone, I wanted to share something personal. A lot of people in the Hindu community might not really know what day-to-day life feels like for Muslims in India, especially those of us who are educated, working in MNCs, or just trying to get by. I’ll also touch on the lives of many who do self-employment or menial jobs.</p><p>For most Muslims, life is very middle class or lower middle class. It’s about making ends meet, sending kids to school, and hoping they get a better future. Just like most families across India. But neighborhoods with higher Muslim populations often face systematic neglect. Sewage systems remain unchanged for decades, overflowing every monsoon. Garbage collection is patchy at best, and residents often pay out of pocket to a garbage collection man. Power and utility management is overlooked. Slowly, a neighborhood becomes a slum — not because the people don’t care, but because the system doesn’t. And when residents complain, things rarely move once it’s tagged as a “Muslim area.”</p><p>Then comes college. An average Muslim student, just 18, wants nothing more than education and a chance to uplift his family. Instead, he hears taunts: <em>“jihadi,”</em> &quot;university ko bomb se uda de, sab pass ho jayenge&quot; <em>“bomb the university and we’ll all pass,”</em> &quot;tumhe to ISIS join karna tha na, yahan kya kar rahe ho&quot; <em>“why aren’t you joining ISIS?”</em> No matter how hard he tries to prove himself, in everyone&#39;s eyes he&#39;s already a terrorist/anti national, a man who can never really assimilate into the community.</p><p>If he pushes through and lands interviews, sometimes offers vanish once the recruiter or interviewer gets to know that the candidate is a muslim. Even when he gets the job, that’s not the end. Some seniors or colleagues throw underhanded or double meaning taunts and remarks or make the environment hostile. You can’t always report it either — because you risk losing the job and starting the discrimanatory process all over again. So you keep your head down, swallow the insults, and try to move on. Not all is bad though, some colleagues are wonderful and supportive — but it hurts when even they go silent when remarks on you get thrown around. You wish someone sided with you but nobody really does. So you have to take the insults and ignore it.</p><p>Then comes housing. Landlords reject you outright. Some do it subtly (<em>“only vegetarians allowed”</em>), others say it plainly. The ones who do agree often hike the rent 20–30%. Which leaves many Muslims stuck in the same neglected neighbourhoods they wanted to escape through education and jobs. Like a perpetual cycle</p><p>And when projects like the Halal Housing community in Mumbai are launched to give Muslims dignity and a cleaner environment, opposition rises instantly. It honestly feels like <em>“jeene bhi nahi denge, marne bhi nahi denge.”</em></p><p>From education, to work, to housing — each step forward pulls you back. That’s the survival of the common Muslim man in India. Not a threat. Not an enemy. Just someone trying to live, in the shadow of a hate-driven separatist environment created by the BJP.</p><p>Me and you — we’re not that different. We both want stability, dignity, and safety. So ask yourself: would you still believe that Muslims are a threat to this nation if you lived this life? Would you live a happy life in you were in my shoes and be proud that you were born in India ?</p><p>This isn’t a rant. It’s a perspective.

India is currently the third-largest supplier of seafood to the US.</p><p>Andhra Pradesh CM <a href="https://www.financialexpress.com/about/n-chandrababu-naidu/">N Chandrababu Naidu</a> has expressed the concern, according to PTI. &ldquo;The taxes imposed by America majorly hit shrimp exports. It is estimated that a loss of Rs 25,000 crore would have occurred. Up to 50 per cent export orders have been cancelled,&rdquo; said Naidu in his letters to the Central Ministers, according to an official press release on Sunday night.</p><h2><strong>Andhra Pradesh&rsquo;s dominant role in shrimp exports</strong></h2><p>The Chief Minister noted that Andhra Pradesh accounts for 80 per cent of India&rsquo;s shrimp exports and 34 per cent of marine exports, valued at around Rs 21,246 crore annually. The sector directly supports 2.5 lakh families, with another 30 lakh people involved in allied industries, Naidu said.</p><p>Naidu also pointed out that seafood consumption in India is far below than global levels, with per capita consumption at just 12-13 kg annually compared to the global average of 20-30 kg. To ease the crisis, the Andhra Pradesh government has persuaded aquaculture feed manufacturers to reduce prices by Rs 9 per kg and is considering supplying subsidised power transformers.</p><h2><strong>Andhra CM flags export losses</strong></h2><p>Naidu has requested the Centre to support the sector through measures such as boosting domestic consumption of aquaculture products, providing financial flexibility under <a href="https://www.financialexpress.com/about/gst/">GST</a>, and offering targeted financial assistance. He also proposed an Rs 100 crore corpus fund, the creation of cold storages, and hygienic fish and seafood markets.</p><p>He also urged the Centre to run dedicated trains to move aquaculture products from South India to other parts of the country and proposed a one-time top-up loan of Rs 1 lakh under Kisan Credit Cards for the fishing community.</p><h2><strong>CM writes to Union ministers seeking sector support</strong></h2><p>Naidu further called for strengthening processing, packaging, and cold-chain facilities to enhance competitiveness in new markets. He also requested the establishment of regional offices of key research institutions such as ICAR-CIBA and ICAR-NBFGR in Andhra Pradesh.</p><p>Naidu has sent separate letters to Union <a href="https://www.financialexpress.com/about/finance-minister/">Finance Minister</a> <a href="https://www.financialexpress.com/about/nirmala-sitharaman/">Nirmala Sitharaman</a>, Commerce Minister <a href="https://www.financialexpress.com/about/piyush-goyal/">Piyush Goyal</a> and Fisheries Minister Rajiv Ranjan Singh.</p></div></section>]]></description><pubDate>Wed, 17 Sep 2025 13:43:34 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1nj22ee/the_india_we_dont_notice_enough/</link><title>The India we don’t notice enough</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1nj22ee/the_india_we_dont_notice_enough/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1nj22ee/the_india_we_dont_notice_enough/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p>Reading time: 2 min | <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1nj22ee/the_india_we_dont_notice_enough/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='separator separator-after-permalink'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='selftext'><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>A few weeks ago, I was waiting at a roadside dhaba on NH-48 because my bus was delayed.

The directive cites a Delhi court&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.barandbench.com/news/delhi-court-restrains-paranjoy-guha-thakurta-activists-from-publishing-defamatory-stories-about-adani">gag order</a> in a defamation case filed by Adani Enterprises Limited (AEL).</p><p>The notice lists 138 YouTube links and 83 Instagram posts, of which Newslaundry has been asked to remove 42 videos from its YouTube channel. The ministry has claimed that the court order was issued on September 6, and that the links were not removed by the media organisations despite the court order. </p><p>The flagged material is not limited to investigative stories but also covers satire and incidental mentions.</p><p>For instance, an NL subscription appeal video was flagged simply because it featured a screenshot of an Adani story. An interview with comedian Kunal Kamra &mdash; where he joked about censorship &mdash; also made it to the list. &ldquo;If I post that Adani is our coal minister &mdash; that&rsquo;s satire in my book. But under this regime, the government can say it&rsquo;s false and strike it down,&rdquo; Kamra had said.</p><p>Episodes of <ins><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpHbno9djTOSaBHKTrtbsKkn6MDUujQxX">TV Newsance</a></ins>, along with an explainer on how the cases against <em>NDTV's</em> former owners Prannoy and Radhika Roy were closed after the Adani takeover of the channel also featured on the list.

Three videos of journalist Atul Chaurasia, includes ones where he discusses the case against Adani in the US. The ministry has also asked the interviews of NCP leaders Sharad Pawar and Ajit Pawar by journalist Sreenivasan Jain to be removed. In these <ins><a href="https://www.thenewsminute.com/news/adani-hosted-amit-shah-attended-sharad-pawar-confirms-2019-meeting-to-discuss-alliance">interviews</a></ins>, both leaders confirmed that Gautam Adani hosted a high-profile meeting in 2019, in which the possibility of the Nationalist Congress Party supporting the Bharatiya Janata Party was discussed.It also includes three videos done by <em>The News Minute</em>, including one episode each of South Central and Let Me Explain, which were hosted on the Newslaundry Youtube channel.&nbsp;</p><p>The MIB letter, dated September 16, 2025, said that publishers had failed to act within the stipulated time. &ldquo;Accordingly, you are directed to take appropriate action for compliance of the aforementioned Order, and submit the action taken to the Ministry within 36 hours of the issue of this communication,&rdquo; it stated.&nbsp;</p><p>Copies of the notice were also marked to Meta Platforms Inc. and Google Inc., placing responsibility on intermediaries to act under the IT (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021.</p><p>The Ministry&rsquo;s directive stems from a September 6, 2025, ex-parte interim injunction passed by Senior Civil Judge Anuj Kumar Singh of the Rohini Courts. The court had ordered to &ldquo;expunge defamatory material from their respective articles/social media posts/tweets and if the same is not feasible, remove the same within 5 days&rdquo;. The order barred journalists Paranjoy Guha Thakurta, Ravi Nair, Abir Dasgupta, Ayaskant Das, Ayush Joshi and several others from publishing any material deemed defamatory against Gautam Adani&rsquo;s company, Adani Enterprises Limited (AEL).</p><p>&ldquo;This is a civil suit in which the court issued instructions to intermediaries. The intermediaries have to act on court takedown notices, why is the government getting involved? Meanwhile, the defendants have filed an appeal against the order which they have a right to do. The court knows how to implement their own orders they don&rsquo;t need the Ministry to do that for them. The Ministry is preempting the judicial process,&rdquo; senior advocate Indira Jaising said.</p><p>An ex-parte ad interim injunction is a temporary court order issued without hearing the other side, usually in urgent situations where swift action is needed to prevent serious or irreparable harm.</p><p>In its plaint, Adani Enterprises Limited (AEL) had alleged that Paranjoy Guha Thakurta through his website <ins><a href="http://paranjoy.in/">paranjoy.in</a></ins>, along with portals like adaniwatch.org and <ins><a href="http://adanifiles.com.au/">adanifiles.com.au</a></ins>, published repeated reports critical of the group&rsquo;s projects and its founder Gautam Adani.</p><p>Paranjoy responded saying he will challenge the order. &ldquo;I stand by my reporting which is verified, factual, fair, balanced, unbiased, and conducted without fear or favour. I have full faith in the judiciary of India and remain confident that all the articles that I have authored or co-authored and all the statements that I have made are not just truthful and accurate but always in the public interest.&rdquo;</p><p>He also noted that this was the seventh defamation case filed against him by Adani group of companies from 2017 onwards.</p><p>Adani, represented by senior advocate Jagdeep Sharma, argued that repeated publication of &ldquo;baseless and malicious&rdquo; reports had damaged its brand equity, delayed projects, and strained investor confidence. The plaint cited repeated references to the 2023 Hindenburg Research report, which alleged financial irregularities, as part of the campaign that harmed the group&rsquo;s reputation. The court agreed that unverified reports could &ldquo;wipe off billions worth of investor&rsquo;s money, create panic in the market, [and cause] loss of goodwill and reputation of plaintiffs at a global scale.&rdquo;</p><p>The order, however, had also observed that fair reporting remains protected. &ldquo;This order shall not be construed to restrain any person from reporting about investigation and court proceedings in relation to the allegations so long as it is fair and accurate reporting based on substantiated and verified material.&rdquo;</p></div></section>]]></description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 23:17:02 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.financialexpress.com/india-news/row-in-gujarat-as-bjp-refuses-to-pay-for-ex-cm-vijay-rupanis-funeral-family-burdened-with-rs-25-lakh-dues/3978768/</link><title>Row in Gujarat as BJP refuses to pay for ex-CM Vijay Rupani’s funeral, family burdened with Rs 25 lakh dues (financialexpress.com)</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1nihy6y/row_in_gujarat_as_bjp_refuses_to_pay_for_excm/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1nihy6y/row_in_gujarat_as_bjp_refuses_to_pay_for_excm/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p>Reading time: 3 min | <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1nihy6y/row_in_gujarat_as_bjp_refuses_to_pay_for_excm/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='preview-image'><img src='https://images.financialexpressdigital.com/2025/09/image-2025-09-15T190822.575.jpg' /></section><section class='parsed-content'><div><p>A row has rocked the political corridors in Gujarat after it was revealed that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) refused to bear the expenses for the funeral of late former Chief Minister Vijay Rupani. The <a href="https://www.financialexpress.com/india-news/former-gujarat-cm-vijay-rupani-killed-in-air-india-plane-crash/3877358/">ex-CM died in the tragic Air India crash</a> near Ahmedabad airport in which all but one passenger died. The grand funeral of Rupani cost the family Rs 25 lakh leaving them shocked after the saffron party denied to pay anything.</p><p>The controversy has hit the party leadership with no one replying to the question. A report in the Indian Express said that state BJP President and Union Minister CR Patil dodged questions on the row during his visit to Rajkot. It stated that questions were posed to both Patil, who is Union Water Resources Minister CR Patil, but they didn&rsquo;t answer.&nbsp;</p><p>The silence, the IE stated, hints at some discord within the party&rsquo;s Gujarat unit.&nbsp;</p><h2>Rupani&rsquo;s funeral: Everyone attended, but family burdened with payment</h2><p>The row came to light three months after Rupani&rsquo;s funeral procession in which top leaders of the saffron party had participated. It was held in Rajkot in presence of Union Home Minister Amit Shah, Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel, several top BJP leaders, thousands of party workers and citizens. It all happened on June 16, 2025, four days after the crash.&nbsp;</p><p>While people came, attended the funeral and went back, the bills for flowers, tents, and other arrangements were quietly passed on to the family of the late CM&rsquo;s family. And BJP did not cover it, the report said.&nbsp;</p><p>The family had no idea about this until the traders and suppliers of material knocked at their doorstep in July seeking their dues. With no relief in sight, the family began paying off the debts, the report further said.&nbsp;</p><p>The painful sight of an ex-CM&rsquo;s family, already mourning their loss, and now burdened with financial strain &ndash; has led to a silent outrage among party leaders.</p><h2>Patil dodges question, hints at internal discord</h2><p>What happened with the family was not as much public as today it is, until CR Patil refused to answer the questions, but did not also reject the claim. In Rajkot to attend a &lsquo;Namotsav&rsquo; program at the Racecourse ground, Patil was asked by reporters about the recently held India-Pak match and the row around it, he ignored it.</p><p>However, when reporters asked about Rupani&rsquo;s funeral and row around its expense, he seemingly dodged the same and made a vague remark, &ldquo;This is a Namotsav matter, I will definitely answer later.&rdquo;</p><p>Citing BJP insiders, the IE reported that the decision to not pay for Rupani&rsquo;s funeral was influenced by two powerful Saurashtra leaders. This indicates a possible power struggle brewing inside the party. The workers and people of Rajkot as well as Saurashtra do not seem satisfied and the anger is evident on the ground, the report said.</p><p><a href="https://www.financialexpress.com/india-news/rat-was-deployed-before-cutoff-aviation-expert-richard-godfrey-shares-root-cause-of-ai-171-crash-rules-out-pilot-error/3941541/">Air India&rsquo;s AI-171 plane</a> had crashed on the building of a medical college seconds after taking off near Ahmedabad airport on June 12, killing a total of 270 people.

They block us from their economy, and they sell to us while we are wide open for them to come in [and] take advantage,&rdquo; Mr. Lutnick said. &ldquo;The president says, &lsquo;fair and reciprocal trade&rsquo;,&rdquo; he added.</p><p>&ldquo;India brags that they have 1.4 billion people. Why won't 1.4 billion people buy one bushel of U.S. corn? Doesn't that rub you the wrong way that they sell everything to us and they won't buy our corn. They put tariffs on everything,&rdquo; Mr. Lutnick said.</p><h4>&lsquo;President's model&rsquo;</h4><p>He added that President Donald Trump has said &ldquo;&lsquo;bring down your tariffs, treat us the way we treat you&rsquo;&rdquo;. The Commerce Secretary further added &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve got to right years of wrong so we want a tariff going the other way until we fix this&rdquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;That's the President's model, and you either accept it or you're going to have a tough time doing business with the world's greatest consumer,&rdquo; Mr. Lutnick said.</p><p>The Trump administration has imposed 50% tariffs on India, including 25% for Delhi&rsquo;s purchases of Russian oil, among the highest imposed on any country in the world.</p><p>India has described the U.S. action as &ldquo;unfair, unjustified and unreasonable&rdquo;. Defending its purchase of Russian crude oil, India has been maintaining that its energy procurement is driven by national interest and market dynamics.</p></div><p>Published <span>- September 14, 2025 08:39 pm IST</span></p></div><div class="gallery"><p><img src="https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/th-online/1x1_spacer.png"></p></div></section>]]></description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 10:19:18 +0530</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
