They told their son, an engineering graduate, about it.</p><p>Kumar&rsquo;s father is a farmer and his mother, a homemaker. They live in a small village in Maharashtra&rsquo;s Osmanabad district. They had worked hard to put their children, a son and a daughter, through engineering college. While their daughter managed to find a job, their son, who graduated with a BTech degree in computer science in 2023, did not hear back from any of the companies to which he had applied.</p><p>The couple thought the internship scheme might offer their son an opportunity to land a job. So, they urged him to apply.</p><p>When he applied in October, he found the process was &ldquo;very simple&rdquo;. He had to supply information about his education and his skills, and from a list of job profiles, choose five that he thought would suit him. &ldquo;However, they didn&rsquo;t provide any information about the companies that were offering the jobs, so I just picked at random,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>He received a positive response within a few days of applying, and was asked to appear for an interview. Within seven days of the interview, Kumar received an internship offer letter from one of the country&rsquo;s top tech companies.</p><p>The family was overjoyed. Kumar, however, was apprehensive. The monthly stipend for the programme was just Rs 5,000, apart from a one-time payment of Rs 6,000 he would receive on joining. Nevertheless, he took up the offer and was posted to an office in Pune, around 300 km from his home.</p><p>Now, nine months into his internship, Kumar fears that it could be a waste of both his time and his money. (He and other interns <em>Scroll</em> spoke to for this story are identified by pseudonyms to protect them from any backlash from the companies they work for.)</p><figure><a href="https://x.com/nsitharamanoffc/status/1817526724055228573/photo/1"> <img src="https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/inline/fccdppeoia-1757315091.jpeg" alt title="The prime minister's internship scheme was launched under the aegis of the corporate affairs ministry in 2024.

He also has various other expenses. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do anything with Rs 5,000,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have to travel about 5 km to the office. I take the bus or an auto to work. So, I have to spend on transport.&rdquo;</p><p>Food is another major expense. &ldquo;The rent money doesn&rsquo;t include the food bill at the paying guest accommodation,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>He also has to pay for his meals at the office canteen &ndash; it &ldquo;costs about 60 to 70 rupees, which is a big expense for me&rdquo;, he explained. To save money, &ldquo;Sometimes I pack some extra breakfast for lunch,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>Apart from these costs, &ldquo;I need to spend on my phone recharges and other miscellaneous expenses that arise now and then,&rdquo; Kumar said.</p><h3>Kumar&rsquo;s monthly expenses amount to around Rs 13,000 &ndash; in effect, he is paying Rs 8,000 out of his pocket to participate in the internship scheme. &ldquo;It is a real struggle,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;For somebody like me who comes from a poor background, this is a huge expense to incur.&rdquo;</h3><p>Kumar is only able to manage because his family sends him money. &ldquo;I know it is very difficult for them to provide me with so much money every month,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>His parents are supporting him in the hope that he will secure a job at the company at the end of his internship. &ldquo;They think that it is okay to make this investment now because I&rsquo;ll get a job,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>But the internship programme does not guarantee jobs. In fact, Nirmala Sitharaman, who is the finance minister and corporate affairs minister, stated earlier this year in the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/india-news/pm-internship-scheme-youth-provide-exposure-jobs-nirmala-sitharaman-125020401192_1.html"><u>Rajya Sabha</u></a> that &ldquo;The intent of the program is not to provide jobs, but to offer exposure and create awareness about market opportunities, so that candidates can be trained accordingly.&rdquo;</p><p>The question of employment is what most frustrates and terrifies Kumar. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m scared that after 12 months, all this would have been a waste,&rdquo; Kumar said. &ldquo;An entire year of my life and so much money.&rdquo;</p><hr><p><strong><em>This story is part of </em></strong><a href="https://scroll.in/topic/56439/common-ground"><strong><em><u>Common Ground</u></em></strong></a><strong><em>, our in-depth and investigative reporting project.

According to a 2024 <a href="https://www.ilo.org/sites/default/files/2024-08/India%20Employment%20-%20web_8%20April.pdf"><u>report</u></a>, in 2022, the unemployment rate among those who had completed their education up to at least the secondary level was 18.4%, while among graduates, the rate was a stark 29.1%. These rates were around six and nine times higher, respectively, than the rate among those who could not read or write.</p><p>The Prime Minister&rsquo;s Internship Scheme, which Sitharaman introduced in the July 2024 budget session of the parliament, represented a major effort by the government to tackle this crisis. The scheme was launched under the corporate affairs ministry with the goal of making youth &ldquo;more employable&rdquo; by industries in the country.</p><figure><img src="https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/inline/ftgdldspsc-1757316447.jpg" alt title="Job-seekers at a job fair organised by the Karnataka state government in Bengaluru in 2024.

Photo for representation: Idrees Mohammed/AFP</figcaption></figure><p>The scheme aimed to provide internships to one crore young people in &ldquo;the top 500 companies&rdquo; in India over the following five years. These companies encompass a wide range, from those in the automobile sector, to those in travel and hospitality, as well as in banking, finance, sales, marketing and other sectors.</p><p>The internships, which last 12 months, are open to those between the ages of 21 and 24 who have at least cleared their Class 10 exams. Candidates cannot be enrolled in a full-time academic programme or have a full-time job, and must not have an annual family income that exceeds Rs 8 lakh. Candidates who have degrees from certain institutions like National Law Universities and Indian Institutes of Technology, or have advanced degrees, are ineligible to apply.</p><p>Of the interns&rsquo; stipend of Rs 5,000, the government pays Rs 4,500, and companies pay Rs 500.</p><p>In the first phase of the scheme&rsquo;s pilot phase, which began in October 2024, 280 companies from around 745 districts advertised more than 1.27 lakh internships. In the second, which began in January 2025, around 327 companies<strong> </strong>advertised more than 1.18 lakh internships, which included some internships that had not been filled in the previous round.</p><p>The website and social media accounts of the corporate affairs ministry carries pictures and videos of the smiling faces of interns who have passed through the programme. In short videos, some speak of the benefits of the internship and how thankful they are to the government for providing them with the opportunity.</p><p>But data on the response to the scheme shows a less rosy picture. In the first round, though 1.81 lakh individuals applied for the 1.27 lakh internships advertised, only 60,000 received offers, indicating that the companies rejected many as unsuitable. Worse, of the 60,000 who had offers, only 8,700 joined their internships. The second round saw 2.14 lakh applicants, of which 72,000 received offers &ndash; but only a little under 23,000 accepted them.</p><figure><a href="https://pminternship.mca.gov.in/login/#gallery-block"> <img src="https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/inline/uxvgzljnxg-1757316927.jpg" alt title="Though the government's publicity material about the internship scheme shows happy interns engaged in productive work, data on the response to the scheme shows a less rosy picture.

Photo: Ministry of Corporate Affairs website</figcaption></figure><p>Activists and experts from the field of youth empowerment and employment say a combination of factors is responsible for the poor response to the scheme.</p><p>Chief among these is that the scheme is aimed at individuals in an age group in which they would be seeking jobs, but offers them only internships.</p><h3>&ldquo;If somebody is looking for a job, then they&rsquo;re looking for a job, right?&rdquo; said Byomkesh Mishra, co-founder of Medha, an organisation that works on youth employment. &ldquo;Internships may help them learn some of the skills and maybe improve their prospects of employment further, but it cannot itself be a proxy for a job.&rdquo;</h3><p>He argued that ideally, internships &ldquo;should be embedded in education&rdquo;. Such programmes &ldquo;have the best impact when they happen while the student or the candidate is still learning or still in the education system. The concept is called work-based learning,&rdquo; he noted.</p><p>But this was not the only problem with the scheme. Job-seekers who were interested in enrolling in the scheme found that most of the internships on offer were concentrated in certain parts of the country, making them difficult for many from other regions to access.</p><p>In the second phase, for instance, companies in Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra offered more than 15,000 internships each, while companies in Gujarat offered around 11,000 internships and those in Karnataka offered close to 10,000. The total of more than 50,000 internships in these states represented just under half of the total number on offer in that phase.</p><p>But apart from Maharashtra, all these states currently have less than 300 interns enrolled in the scheme. Instead, the five states where the most number of interns enrolled are Assam, with 1,408 interns, Uttar Pradesh, with 1,067, Bihar, with 634, Odisha, with 420, and Kerala, with 516.</p><p>Tanoj Meshram, a public policy researcher and professor at the SP Jain Institute of Management and Research, argued that these numbers suggested that &ldquo;since the stipends are so low, candidates who mostly have no other options might have taken up the internships.&rdquo; He added, &ldquo;It could be that candidates in Assam were most in need of jobs, and so they took up the offers.&rdquo;</p><p>Aamir Nurule, who works with an organisation that holds job fairs and aids students in recruitment, noted that the National Apprenticeship Promotion Scheme, which provides year-long apprenticeships to young people, pays them stipends ranging between Rs 6,000 and Rs 10,000. &ldquo;The reimbursement is higher than the PM Internship Scheme,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Why would students opt for the internship scheme then?&rdquo; </p><p><em>Scroll</em> emailed the corporate affairs ministry, seeking responses to criticisms about the scheme &ndash; this story will be updated if any responses are received.</p><hr><p><strong>L</strong>ike Kumar, Praveen Arun is also struggling to meet his expenses after enrolling in the internship programme, with a company in Chandigarh. Arun, who belongs to a family of farmers from a small town in Bihar, graduated from a college in Punjab this year with an engineering degree, and was disappointed with how placements were conducted in his college. Most of the companies that visited were hiring for sales positions, he noted, and not for engineering ones.</p><p>Staff at his college suggested that he apply to the prime minister&rsquo;s internship scheme. &ldquo;I had never heard about it until the staff mentioned it to me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t even asked to fill in the application, the college did it for me. They asked for some documents and asked me to choose three companies I would like to join.&rdquo;</p><p>When he was selected and appeared for the interview, Arun sought to understand from his interviewers what benefit he would gain by taking up this internship, and particularly if it would eventually lead to a job. &ldquo;They told me that the government had only directed them to provide internships so far,&rdquo; Arun said. &ldquo;And so until the government gave them any further instructions, they would not be able to assure me of a job.&rdquo;</p><p>Though he was disappointed, he recounted, &ldquo;An internship seemed like a better option than sitting at home.&rdquo;</p><p>Arun was offered an internship in Bengaluru, which he would have accepted had he been able to afford the expenses. &ldquo;Bengaluru is the IT hub. The exposure would have been very good for me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But it would have been too expensive for me to move there for a year.&rdquo;</p><p>Instead, he took up the offer in Chandigarh. &ldquo;But in Chandigarh, only one such software company exists,&rdquo; he said. Since he had completed his engineering degree in Punjab, he was familiar with the city and more confident of navigating its challenges.</p><figure><img src="https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/inline/kixriedtjl-1757317456.jpg" alt title="A coding event in 2012 in Bengaluru.

Photo for representation: Manjunath Kiran/AFP</figcaption></figure><p>But even Chandigarh is proving expensive &ndash; Arun spends between Rs 15,000 and Rs 17,000 each month.</p><h3>&ldquo;Since Chandigarh doesn&rsquo;t have too many industries, there weren&rsquo;t any paying guest accommodations that exist in the city and most were already full. So I had to rent out a room,&rdquo; he said.</h3><p>Like Kumar, for the bulk of his expenses, Arun depends on his family. &ldquo;It is difficult for them to arrange the money for me every month,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>Sayyed Etemaad, a 21-year-old pharmacy student, faced the same problem. Etemaad, a resident of Amravati, applied and was selected under the scheme, but realised that the centre nearest to him was Aurangabad, 300 km away. &ldquo;The travel, accommodation and food would cost me way more than the internship money,&rdquo; he told <em>Scroll</em>. &ldquo;I did not take up any offers.&rdquo; </p><p>His friend and fellow pharmacy student, Kamran Ahmad, also decided against applying. &ldquo;The starting package for a fresh graduate of pharmacy is Rs 4 lakh per annum,&rdquo; Ahmad said. &ldquo;But the internship paid almost nothing.&rdquo;</p><hr><p>The low stipend is not the only problem that interns struggle with. Kumar explained that he also feels that his time at the company is not well utilised.</p><p>He is required to be in his office by 10 am. Though his internship is supposed to be in the field of software development, he is usually not given any project to work on.</p><p>Instead, he sits at the desk allocated to him, sets his laptop on it and does &ldquo;self study&rdquo;, he said.</p><h3>&ldquo;On some days, my mentor will check in and find out how my skill development is going,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;But he does not give me any work to do.&rdquo;</h3><p>Thus, on most days, he spends his hours in the office preparing for future job interviews. At 5 pm, he leaves and returns to his place of accommodation.</p><p>Some of his peers have had better luck, he noted. &ldquo;Some of my friends have different mentors, who give them software development work,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;So, whether or not you get work also depends on whose care you are under.&rdquo;</p><p>But those who take up internships through other avenues have a uniformly better experience, he explained. &ldquo;Those who come from big institutions like the IITs or other big colleges are given a lot of work to do all day,&rdquo; Kumar said.</p><p>Other interns also receive significantly more pay. Kumar noted that in his company, some interns who were still undergraduate students were paid stipends of between Rs 12,000 and Rs 15,000, up to three times more than interns in the government scheme. Meanwhile, interns from IITs are given a much higher stipend, he said.</p><p>&ldquo;It is very discriminatory in the way that they treat the interns who come in through the scheme, and other interns,&rdquo; he added.</p><p>In fact, in Arun&rsquo;s company, the programme for interns who enroll through the government scheme was structured in such a way as to separate them from other interns.</p><p>Most other interns, he noted, were sent to a main internship centre in South India. Those that entered through the government scheme, however, were allocated to centres in other cities, including Chandigarh, where only they worked. &ldquo;It is only the PMIS interns who are distributed in other branches of the company,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Because there are hundreds of us that have come in through the scheme, we were told that they would not have been able to accommodate all of us at the internship centre.&rdquo;</p><p>The interns <em>Scroll</em> spoke to were also largely disappointed with the training they have received so far at these centres. &ldquo;The company conducted training for us only for seven days,&rdquo; Kumar said.</p><p>He noted that the training was &ldquo;very basic, just an introduction to the subject&rdquo; &ndash; the kind that could be easily gained through online programmes. In contrast, new employees at the company undergo a more intensive three-month training, he explained.</p><figure><img src="https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/inline/vtrudbdzxm-1757317702.jpg" alt title="Interns noted that they were not given much work to do during their internships.

Photo for representation: Parivartan Sharma/Reuters</figcaption></figure><p>Raj&rsquo;s experience was similar. &ldquo;Maybe people who come from other streams, these sessions will be helpful,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But for somebody who is coming from a software background, these lessons are repetitive.&rdquo; He and Kumar both also argued that 12 months was too long a duration for an internship at what is a crucial period in a young person&rsquo;s life &ndash; in their view, six months would be sufficient to impart important skills to them.</p><p>Kumar rued the fact that the company gave them no information about the internship beforehand. &ldquo;It would be good to know what the curriculum is for the year,&rdquo; he said.</p><h3>Meshram echoed this view. &ldquo;When the internships were announced, the companies should have announced a series of roles for which people can apply &ndash; the roles should have very specific descriptions,&rdquo; he said.</h3><p>Rafique Shaikh, a recruitment agent, described the scheme as a &ldquo;great platform to connect youth with big corporations&rdquo;. But, he noted, applicants &ldquo;can only apply in three companies which limits their options. And the job description is very basic, making it vague for a candidate.&rdquo;</p><p>Meshram noted, &ldquo;Candidates need to know that with the training that they are getting, they have been kind of certified for a specific job, and after completion of the internship, if not in that company, they should be able to land a job somewhere else.&rdquo;</p><p>The only clear benefit that both Raj and Kumar said they had gained from their internship so far was an improvement in their communication skills. &ldquo;When I initially joined the office, I was awkward and hesitant to talk to others at the office,&rdquo; Kumar said. &ldquo;But my communication skills have improved since I joined.&rdquo;</p><p>But all three interns <em>Scroll </em>spoke to said that they were not particularly committed to completing their internships and would quit if they found a job or any better opportunities. &ldquo;Who wants to work as an intern with a pay of Rs 5,000?

The research found Indian-Americans gave Trump just 0.6% of their political donations in 2016, among his weakest support from any ethnic group. The study did not encompass the donations in the run-up to the 2024 US Presidential elections.</p><p>The researchers analysed campaign donation records from OpenSecrets, a nonprofit that compiles Federal Election Commission data on all political contributions, examining 22 years of filings from 2000 to 2022. Since donor records include names and addresses but no ethnicity information, the team developed a system to identify Indian-American donors by their names.</p><p>They used a database of nearly 39 million names from Facebook data to determine which names are significantly more common in India than the United States. However, they excluded donors with Muslim names like Khan because these appear frequently across several countries, making it impossible to confirm Indian origin.</p><p>The study likely undercounts Indian-American Muslims and Christians with anglicised names, but the researchers manually verified all major contributors to ensure accuracy of the overall funding patterns.</p><figure><blockquote><p>Trump&rsquo;s tariffs on India may be partly explained by who funds his politics. Our study of two decades of Indian American lobbying in the US shows a strong, consistent Democrat lean, with Trump-1 scoring among the lowest ever share from Indian Americans (1/n) <a href="https://t.co/w8vVmUG3Gz">pic.twitter.com/w8vVmUG3Gz</a></p>&mdash; joyojeet pal (@joyopal) <a href="https://twitter.com/joyopal/status/1965096710822396183?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 8, 2025</a></blockquote> </figure><p>The research showed how the Indian American community has grown as a political force in the country. From 2000 to 2023, the population of the community surged by over 150%, growing from 1.9 million to more than 4.9 million, making them the largest Asian-American subgroup.</p><p>This demographic expansion has been accompanied by increasing affluence, with Indian-Americans boasting a median household income of $145,000 and 80% holding bachelor&rsquo;s degrees or higher, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/2024/08/06/indian-americans-a-survey-data-snapshot/">according</a> to Pew Research Center data from 2024.</p><p>The community increased political donations by 550% over two decades, from roughly 6,700 contributors in 2000 to more than 43,000 in 2020. All six Indian-Americans currently serving in Congress are Democrats.</p><p>However, despite representing 1.5% of the U.S. population, Indian-Americans contribute only about 1% of total campaign funding, suggesting the community donates below what their demographic weight might indicate.</p><p>Healthcare professionals, including over 3,600 physicians, comprise the largest donor group by numbers and dominate contributions in 42 states. But finance professionals wield outsized influence through larger individual donations, contributing $24.8 million in 2020 compared to healthcare&rsquo;s $20.2 million. Technology workers contributed $7.4 million despite Silicon Valley&rsquo;s reputation as an Indian-American stronghold.</p><p>Much of the community&rsquo;s political influence operates through &ldquo;bundlers&rdquo; &ndash; well-connected individuals who organise fundraising events rather than making large personal donations themselves. These fundraisers can raise millions through single events while requiring candidates to do little more than attend brief meet-and-greets.</p><p>Prominent bundlers include venture capitalist Ramesh Kapur and former Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, who organise high-dollar fundraising events for Democratic candidates. The study notes that in 2020, Indian-Americans comprised 3% of Joe Biden&rsquo;s bundlers.</p><h3>Political launchpad</h3><p>The study also found that Indian-American candidates use their community as a political launchpad. Ro Khanna raised 80% of early campaign funds from Indian-American donors. Congressional hopeful Suraj Patel raised $5.5 million largely from donors sharing his surname, reflecting caste networks. However, successful candidates gradually diversify their funding base once they are established in American politics.</p><p>Indian-Americans in California alone contributed $34.3 million in 2020, with finance professionals in the state giving over $10 million. New York and New Jersey round out the top three states, together accounting for the majority of Indian-American political funding.</p><p>Indian-Americans are heavily represented in these states&rsquo; key industries: technology in California, finance in New York, and healthcare across all major metropolitan areas.</p><p>While most Indian-Americans are Hindu, their voting patterns diverge from Hindu nationalist politics in India. &ldquo;The policy positions of Indian-Americans, particularly prominent Indian-American political figures, are often very distinct from conventional Hindu political talking points,&rdquo; the study notes.</p><p>However, some wealthy Hindu Americans break from this pattern. Harshad Patel, who heads the Gujarati Samaj of New York, held a private fundraiser for mayor Eric Adams earlier this year and opposed Democratic socialist and Indian-origin candidate Zohran Mamdani for his criticism of Prime Minister Narendra Modi&rsquo;s policies.</p><p>Other Hindutva-supporting groups in the US are <a href="https://scroll.in/article/1083811/why-some-hindu-americans-are-opposing-the-first-south-asian-to-run-in-new-yorks-mayoral-poll">mobilising funds</a> for Andrew Cuomo, who is also running for New York mayor against Mamdani.</p></div><i> We welcome your comments at <a href="https://scroll.inmailto:?Subject=Indian-Americans%20donate%20three%20times%20more%20to%20Democrats%20than%20Republicans%2C%20shows%20new%20studyto=letters@scroll.in">letters@scroll.in</a>. </i> <ul><li> <a href="https://scroll.in//scroll.in/tag/Donald-Trump"> Donald Trump </a> </li><li> <a href="https://scroll.in//scroll.in/tag/Indian_Americans"> Indian-Americans </a> </li><li> <a href="https://scroll.in//scroll.in/tag/Narendra-Modi"> Narendra Modi </a> </li></ul> </section> </section>]]></description><pubDate>Sat, 13 Sep 2025 09:14:43 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.indiatoday.in/world/us-news/story/what-donald-trump-us-president-charlie-kirk-said-op-sindoor-pahalgam-terror-attack-india-immigration-visas-trade-2785604-2025-09-11</link><title>Not our war, Charlie Kirk said on Op Sindoor; was against visa for Indians (indiatoday.in)</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1nfabuw/not_our_war_charlie_kirk_said_on_op_sindoor_was/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1nfabuw/not_our_war_charlie_kirk_said_on_op_sindoor_was/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p>Reading time: 6 min | <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1nfabuw/not_our_war_charlie_kirk_said_on_op_sindoor_was/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='separator separator-before-parsed-content'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='parsed-content'><div><h2>President Trump's supporter and conservative influencer Charlie Kirk was shot dead at a Utah rally.

The rally, attended by more than 3,000 people and centred on what Kirk called the "great American comeback".</p><p>Kirk co-founded the youth activist group Turning Point USA in 2012 and became a familiar presence on college campuses, where his rallies, like the one in Utah, often drew large audiences. He amassed 5.2 million followers on the platform X and<strong><a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/world/us-news/story/charlie-kirk-shot-dead-utah-campus-event-turning-point-usa-founder-2785433-2025-09-11"> had a popular podcast called "The Charlie Kirk Show".</a></strong></p><p>The 31-year-old had built a strong following among young people through his posts and podcast, while also drawing criticism for his often controversial views. It is this divide that has made his death send shockwaves across the political spectrum.</p><p>US President Donald Trump <strong><a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/world/us-news/story/charlie-kirk-assassination-donald-trump-mourns-beloved-conservative-leader-2785426-2025-09-11">called it a "dark moment for America</a></strong>," saying he was "filled with grief and anger at the heinous assassination of Charlie Kirk."</p><p>Kirk had also spoken about India on two issues that matter to Indians: <strong><a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/topic/operation-sindoor">Operation Sindoor</a></strong> and immigration to the US.</p><h3>WHY CHARLIE KIRK SPOKE ABOUT OPERATION SINDOOR?</h3><p>On his podcast, Charlie Kirk weighed in on the escalating tensions between India and Pakistan after the terror attack in Pahalgam, which killed 22 people, and Operation Sindoor. He dismissed the idea of American involvement in the conflict, framing it instead as a test of whether "every conflict is America&rsquo;s problem".</p><p>Kirk, who has about 4 million subscribers on YouTube, uploaded a video on the issue on May 8. The four-day war between India and Pakistan started on May 7, with Pakistan seeking a ceasefire on May 10.</p><p>"India and Pakistan are on the verge of a war. What does this mean exactly? Well, here's the basics," Kirk told his audience even as India and Pakistan were engaged in the military conflict.</p><p>"Pakistan is 100% Muslim. Remember, they sheltered Bin Laden and have been a very, very sneaky actor. India is mostly Hindu. They don&rsquo;t care for each other much at all."</p><p>He went on to describe the Kashmir situation as he saw it. "There was just a Muslim terrorist attack on tourists there, which Pakistan seems to be linked to, so India is furious," he said.</p><p>Kirk reminded his listeners of the global stakes, pointing out that both India and Pakistan are nuclear powers.</p><p>"These are big countries. They have more than 1.7 billion people between them and lots of people," he noted.</p><p>But he downplayed the chance of a nuclear escalation. India, in fact, called out Pakistan's nuclear bluff with Operation Sindoor.</p><p>"I do not believe this will escalate in any way, shape, or form to nuclear power. Look, we hope for negotiations, but this is a great test of whether or not every conflict is America&rsquo;s problem."</p><p>His message was clear: the United States should stay out. "This is not our war. Maybe we slightly favour India because they&rsquo;re retaliating to Islamic terror, but that should go no further than moral support. That is it. This is not our conflict to get involved in," Kirk stressed.</p><p>Kirk also warned against American overreach, taking aim at hawkish politicians in Washington.</p><p>"The only role that we should have is to help negotiations and have moral support. This is not our fight. This is not our region," he summed it up.</p><p>Kirk's views were aligned with Trump's campaign promise of not getting into "foreign wars".</p><h3>US DOES NOT NEED MORE INDIANS, SAID CHARLIE KIRK</h3><p>Kirk had a controversial take on immigration from India, which is mostly that of skilled professionals, particularly in the tech sector. The H-1B visa, that facilitates the stay of Indian techies in the US and helps American tech giants, has been under fire from Trump aides and the MAGA crowd.</p><p>On September 2, Kirk declared on X (formerly Twitter) that the US did not need to provide more visas to Indians, arguing that the country was "full" and that Indian workers were "displacing" Americans.</p><p>"America does not need more visas for people from India. Perhaps no form of legal immigration has so displaced American workers as those from India. Enough already. We&rsquo;re full. Let&rsquo;s finally put our own people first," he wrote.</p><p>His post was a response to Fox News host Laura Ingraham, who had argued that any US trade deal with India would likely require offering more visas. "I'd rather not pay them in visas and trade deficits," Ingraham had posted, to which Kirk offered his absolute agreement.</p><p>It is Kirk's conservative views that made him popular among Americans, particularly the MAGA crowd. Others knew him because of the controversies stemming from his ideas. His death has shocked his supporters and critics alike.</p><p>- Ends</p><div><div><p>Published By: </p><p>Priyanjali Narayan</p></div><div><p>Published On: </p><p>Sep 11, 2025</p></div></div></div><div class="gallery"><p><img src="https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/author/IndiaToday_12-profile_image_one_to_one.jpg?VersionId=02.7SPXRm.XnAwNPNgib0PTaZUYdisRV&amp;size=50:50"></p></div></section>]]></description><pubDate>Fri, 12 Sep 2025 23:36:36 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-141-others-vote-in-favour-of-hamas-free-palestinian-state-in-un-general-assembly-101757694698044.html</link><title>India, 141 others vote in favour of Hamas-free Palestinian state in UNGA (hindustantimes.com)</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1nf8reu/india_141_others_vote_in_favour_of_hamasfree/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1nf8reu/india_141_others_vote_in_favour_of_hamasfree/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p>Reading time: 4 min | <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1nf8reu/india_141_others_vote_in_favour_of_hamasfree/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='preview-image'><img src='https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/09/12/1600x900/ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS-UN-16_1757694925287_1757694937176.JPG' /></section><section class='parsed-content'><div><div><p>Updated on: Sept 12, 2025 10:47 pm IST </p></div><h2>India was among the 142 countries which voted in favour of the declaration, while 10 countries voted against it and 12 decided to abstain from voting.</h2><div><div><p>The United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) voted on Friday to back the &ldquo;New York Declaration&rdquo;, which seeks a two-state solution for the long-standing conflict between Israel and Palestine but without the involvement of Hamas, which currently controls the Gaza strip.</p><figure> <figcaption>Riyad H.

My uncle&#39;s wife is my aunt.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What do we wear on parties, birthdays and weddings? We wear colourful dress on parties, birthdays and weddings.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What do you see in a classroom? I see in the classroom: blackboard, desk and teacher&quot;</p><p>&quot;Why do we wear clothes? We wear clothes to cover our bodies from heat, cold and rain.&quot;</p><p>And if that wasn&#39;t enough, they&#39;re given True/False questions like:</p><p>&quot;My school has a big building.&quot;&quot;We do not learn many things at school.&quot;&quot;Clothes protect us from rain only.&quot;</p><p>Excuse me?? These are 4 year old kids who donâ€™t even fully understand how sentences are formed, why &quot;I&quot; goes with &quot;am&quot; and not &quot;is,&quot; or even basic grammar. And yet schools are already treating them like mini-exam candidates, forcing them to parrot full sentences they don&#39;t understand.</p><p>What exactly is the point here? It&#39;s not comprehension. It&#39;s not communication. Itâ€™s just mugging. The teachers don&#39;t care if the kid knows what an &quot;aunt&quot; actually means, they just care if the kid writes the model answer word for word.</p><p>And True/False questions for toddlers? Are we serious? Logical reasoning comes with maturity, but nope letâ€™s test 4 year olds on abstract statements about school buildings and &quot;learning many things.&quot; It&#39;s laughable if it weren&#39;t so depressing.</p><p>At this age, kids should be playing, learning sounds, colors, shapes, talking, and listening. </p><p>This system kills creativity before it even begins. No wonder so many kids grow up associating studies with pressure and fear rather than joy and curiosity.</p><p>Honestly, seeing this made me angry. If this is the &quot;foundation&quot; we&#39;re giving kids, what hope is there for actual critical thinking later? The Indian education system needs a complete reset â€” because right now, it&#39;s nothing short of absurd.</p><p>Edit: People are seemingly misunderstanding me. I donâ€™t have a problem with these topics being introduced. A 4 year old should have knowledge about these things, but they should only be taught and assessed orally. Writing seems like a stretch to me.</p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section>]]></description><pubDate>Fri, 12 Sep 2025 20:26:39 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/indian-woman-dies-trying-to-escape-kathmandu-hotel-set-on-fire-by-protesters-9263026?pfrom=home-ndtv_topscroll</link><title>Indian Woman Dies Trying To Escape Kathmandu Hotel Set On Fire By Protesters (ndtv.com)</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1nexek9/indian_woman_dies_trying_to_escape_kathmandu/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1nexek9/indian_woman_dies_trying_to_escape_kathmandu/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1nexek9/indian_woman_dies_trying_to_escape_kathmandu/'>Post permalink</a></p></section>]]></description><pubDate>Fri, 12 Sep 2025 13:39:38 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.livemint.com/news/us-news/indian-man-chandra-nagamallaiah-stabbed-beheaded-at-dallas-motel-police-arrest-suspect-in-blood-soaked-t-shirt-11757638585712.html</link><title>Indian man stabbed, beheaded at Dallas motel; police arrest suspect in blood-soaked T-shirt (livemint.com)</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1neq9c8/indian_man_stabbed_beheaded_at_dallas_motel/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1neq9c8/indian_man_stabbed_beheaded_at_dallas_motel/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p>Reading time: 2 min | <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1neq9c8/indian_man_stabbed_beheaded_at_dallas_motel/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='preview-image'><img src='https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2025/09/12/1600x900/crime_1706841490453_1757638747727.jpg' /></section><section class='parsed-content'><div><p>In a horrific incident, a 50-year-old Indian motel manager, Chandra Nagamallaiah, was <a href="https://www.livemint.com/news/us-news/charlie-kirk-trump-ally-conservative-activist-dies-after-being-shot-at-utah-college-event-11757540738592.html">fatally stabbed and beheaded at the </a>Downtown Suites motel in Dallas on Wednesday morning, reported nbcdfw.com.

He said, &quot;your uncle doesn&#39;t want to work, he&#39;s lazy as always and now sleeps and roams around like he used to at home.&quot; We asked him to let us talk to him, nonetheless.</p><p>Next day we got a call from my uncle who told us that the neighbor took his passport and they, with few other Indians, crossed border and trafficked into Myanmar. They are told to steal and loot from people. If they don&#39;t do that, the gang leave them stranded on an island in the middle of jungle as a punishment</p><p>He shared his location with us and told us they are asking for a ransom of INR 400K.

We transferred the first payment and then my uncle was told to wait for the car to pick him up.

The embassy tweeted saying- &quot;In case of no response and cooperation, we&#39;re closing the case. Please deal with your neighbor.&quot; TF? I mean if I&#39;m telling you the exact address of a human trafficker, aren&#39;t you supposed to deal with it????</p><p>Seeing no way out, we bluffed and risked it. We told the neighbor that we&#39;ll kidnap his 22yo daughter and marry her off to some 50-55yo dude. As she lived just next door and the neighbor being in Thailand, he paid the ransom himself and got my uncle back to his home in 4 days.</p><p>My uncle isn&#39;t speaking much, and he doesn&#39;t have any external injury. We&#39;ll get his medical done soon.</p><p>Edit: My uncle also said that there are 10-15 Indians taken there everyday.
