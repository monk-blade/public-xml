So as usual I got into a bus after college. Travelled for the usual 20 mins and my stop was approaching so I slowly got up, planning to stand till my stop reached. A guy tried to GRAB my private parts, I acted quick and slapped him. People around me started asking about what he did and I explained to them and I went back and slapped again. Unfortunately my stop reached and I got down. Regardless I’m so proud of myself.</p><p>I’ve been studying in Delhi for the past two years. I’ve had plenty of shitty experiences where I was taken advantage of by men and even a woman at one point. I never had the courage to act up. I would just curl up and cry blaming my fate. I stood up this time. And there is nothing more satisfying!!!💪</p><p>Note - I initially posted this on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/delhi">r/delhi</a>.

Earlier in the day, Gandhi gave a PowerPoint presentation and provided documents. He claimed that this was proof of large-scale voter fraud by the BJP and the Election Commission.</p><p>&ldquo;While the Election Commission of India is functioning without bias, Rahul Gandhi is busy weakening democracy, misleading citizens, and trying to create a situation like Bangladesh and Nepal,&rdquo; Thakur said, accusing the Congress leader of undermining democratic institutions.</p><p>Thakur countered Gandhi&rsquo;s Karnataka example, saying: &ldquo;According to records, the Aland Assembly seat was won by the Congress candidate in 2023 with a margin of 10,348 votes. So, Mr Rahul Gandhi, did Congress win that seat through vote chori? Today Rahul Gandhi himself admitted something in his own words &mdash; it was like dropping a hydrogen bomb on himself. He said, &lsquo;I have not come to save democracy.&rsquo; Is he preparing to destroy democracy?&rdquo;</p><p>Taking a dig at Gandhi&rsquo;s repeated defeats, Thakur said that the Congress MP from Wayanad is getting frustrated day-by-day. He added that Rahul Gandhi has become habitual of making false and baseless statements.</p><p>&ldquo;The Congress has lost approximately 90 elections under the leadership of Rahul Gandhi. His frustration is increasing day-by-day... It has become a habit of Rahul Gandhi to make incorrect and baseless allegations. Seeking apology and being reprimanded by the courts have become a routine of Rahul Gandhi.&rdquo;</p><p>He mocked Gandhi&rsquo;s dramatic warning of a &ldquo;hydrogen bomb,&rdquo; saying the much-hyped expos&eacute; fizzled out: &ldquo;While he promised a hydrogen bomb, he came only with firecrackers.&rdquo;</p><p>At the presser, Gandhi alleged that voter lists were being manipulated through software and fraudulent applications, with minorities being deliberately targeted. He cited examples from Karnataka&rsquo;s Aland constituency, claiming that over 6,000 names had been deleted using phone numbers linked to people outside the state.</p><p>He further accused the poll body and Chief Election Commissioner Gyanesh Kumar of presiding over a &ldquo;systematic, mass deletion of voters&rdquo; in Congress-dominated pockets ahead of the 2023 Karnataka assembly polls.</p><p>The Election Commission, however, brushed off the claims, calling them &ldquo;incorrect and baseless.&rdquo; Officials clarified that voter deletions cannot be carried out online by the public and that no removal from the rolls takes place without notifying the individual concerned and giving them a chance to respond.</p></div><div><p><span>Published on: Sep 18, 2025 3:25 PM IST</span> </p></div></div></section>]]></description><pubDate>Thu, 18 Sep 2025 18:12:54 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1nk5qu9/to_anyone_wondering_why_rahul_gandhi_is_not/</link><title>To anyone wondering why Rahul Gandhi is not taking the Vote Chori allegation to Supreme Court here is why</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1nk5qu9/to_anyone_wondering_why_rahul_gandhi_is_not/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1nk5qu9/to_anyone_wondering_why_rahul_gandhi_is_not/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p>Reading time: 2 min | <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1nk5qu9/to_anyone_wondering_why_rahul_gandhi_is_not/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='separator separator-after-permalink'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='selftext'><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>These two examples show why taking a matter to the Supreme Court is a no-win situation.</p><p><strong>Example 1: The Vantara Verdict</strong><br/>Two written applications were submitted to the courts, alleging that Vantara was unlawfully acquiring animals and mistreating them in captivity. In its verdict, however, <strong><em>&quot;the Supreme Court stated that the SIT’s “exhaustive investigation” found no violation of the law and asserted that it would not allow tarnishing news reports about the rescue park in Jamnagar, Gujarat&quot;</em></strong>. This decision effectively gave Vantara a clean chit and brought the matter to a definitive close. This decision was perceived by the public as favoring the powerful. [<em>No disrespect to the Rescue park folks and the Supreme Court here this is just my opinion and not a comment on your working or integrity</em>]</p><p><strong>Example 2: The Election CCTV Hearing</strong><br/>In another case, the Haryana and Punjab High Court directed the Election Commission to provide CCTV footage related to the Haryana Assembly elections, following a petition by counsel Mehmood Pracha. Within three days, the government amended the law to prevent public access to electronic documents and recordings connected to elections, justifying the change as a way to “ <em>preventing the misuse of electronic election records. This includes CCTV camera and webcasting footage, as well as video recordings of candidates, during the election process.&quot;</em> Doubling down on this , the retention period for election CCTV footage was also shortened—from 1year to just 45 days, after which the recordings would be deleted. This maneuver effectively rendered the High Court’s verdict meaningless.</p><p>Taken together, these examples suggest that even if Rahul Gandhi were to win his case in the Supreme Court, the government could simply introduce new legislation to block the release of critical data. And if he were to lose, public perception might lean toward suspicion of foul play [ <em>Again, no disrespect is intended toward the Supreme Court—I deeply appreciate its strong stance on issues like the electoral bonds case</em>] .It would also effectively end any further discussion on the matter once the Supreme Court has delivered its judgment.</p><p>As Rahul Gandhi himself emphasized during his press conference, he will just present the facts, and it will ultimately be up to the public and the country’s youth to decide what to do next.</p><p>P.S. I did use ChatGPT to make the post more understandable</p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section>]]></description><pubDate>Thu, 18 Sep 2025 17:01:29 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/trump-names-afghanistan-india-china-pakistan-among-major-drug-transit-illicit-drug-producing-countries/article70064066.ece</link><title>Trump names Afghanistan, India, China, Pakistan among major drug transit, illicit drug producing countries (thehindu.com)</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1nk23uw/trump_names_afghanistan_india_china_pakistan/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1nk23uw/trump_names_afghanistan_india_china_pakistan/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p>Reading time: 4 min | <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1nk23uw/trump_names_afghanistan_india_china_pakistan/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='preview-image'><img src='https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/q5dik3/article70064079.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/2025-09-16T164503Z_1708444932_RC24BFAG57UT_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP.JPG' /></section><section class='parsed-content'><div><p>President Donald Trump has named China, Afghanistan, India and Pakistan among 23 major drug transit or major illicit drug producing countries, saying that by manufacturing and trafficking illicit drugs and precursor chemicals, these nations are threatening the safety of the U.S. and its citizens.</p><p>In a &lsquo;Presidential Determination&rsquo; submitted to Congress on Monday (September 15, 2025), Mr. Trump said he has identified 23 countries as &ldquo;major drug transit or major illicit drug producing&rdquo; nations.</p><p>These nations are Afghanistan, The Bahamas, Belize, Bolivia, Burma, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, India, Jamaica, Laos, Mexico, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Panama, Peru, and Venezuela.</p><p>Mr. Trump delivered the &ldquo;Major&rsquo;s List&rdquo; to Congress, designating these countries as responsible for sourcing and transporting illicit drugs into the U.S., the White House said.</p><p>The State Department announced the Presidential Determination of these 23 countries, with five countries &mdash; Afghanistan, Bolivia, Burma, Colombia, and Venezuela &mdash; listed as having &ldquo;failed demonstrably to make substantial efforts,&rdquo; calling upon them to improve their counternarcotics efforts.</p><div></div><p>By manufacturing and trafficking illicit drugs and precursor chemicals, these countries are threatening the safety of the United States and its citizens, the State Department said in a statement.</p><p>The State Department clarified that a country's presence on the list does not necessarily reflect its government's counterdrug efforts or level of cooperation with the United States.</p><p>The listing is based on "the combination of geographic, commercial, and economic factors that allow drugs or precursor chemicals to be transited or produced, even if a government has engaged in robust and diligent narcotics control and law enforcement measures,&rdquo; it said.</p><p>Mr. Trump said Afghanistan, Bolivia, Burma, Colombia, and Venezuela have failed &ldquo;demonstrably&rdquo; during the previous 12 months to both adhere to their obligations under international counternarcotics agreements and to take the relevant measures to combat the threat.</p><p>On China, Mr. Trump said the country's role as the "world's largest source&rdquo; of precursor chemicals fuelling illicit fentanyl production has been well documented.</p><p>Mr. Trump also said that China is also a major supplier fuelling global epidemics of other synthetic narcotics, including nitazenes and methamphetamine.</p><p>The Chinese leadership &ldquo;can and must take stronger and sustained action to cut down these chemical flows and prosecute the drug criminals facilitating them.&rdquo; </p><p>On Afghanistan, Mr. Trump said that despite the Taliban's announced ban on illegal drugs, drug stockpiles and ongoing production &mdash; including expanding production of methamphetamine &mdash; have sustained the flow of drugs to international markets.</p><p>"Revenue from this drug trade funds transnational criminal groups and supports international terrorists.

Speaking at the India Today South Conclave, he argued that nearly 50% of a property&rsquo;s cost goes straight to government taxes and charges, leaving little room for affordability.</p><div><h4>Related Articles</h4></div><p>&ldquo;Government only takes away nearly 50% through the taxes on the property. So they need to first fix that,&rdquo; Dutt said, pointing to the many hidden levies stacked on top of GST.</p><p>While GST on under-construction affordable housing is just 1%, and 5% on other residential properties, that&rsquo;s only the beginning. Buyers also pay stamp duty (5&ndash;8%), registration charges, municipal fees, development cesses, and premiums for extra floor area. Industry estimates confirm that, once land premiums, approvals, compliance, and infrastructure charges are added in, the government&rsquo;s share can climb to 30&ndash;50% of project costs in urban markets.</p><p>Dutt also flagged land as a crippling factor, often accounting for 50&ndash;85% of project costs in metros. He said government bodies like the Railways, Defense, Port Trusts, and municipal corporations hold vast tracts of unused land that could be unlocked for housing. &ldquo;They need to monetize and unlock those, make land cheaper for affordable housing, and then allow private developers to build under tax benefits,&rdquo; he urged.</p><p>But high taxes and expensive land aren&rsquo;t the only issues. Financing remains costly, and infrastructure often fails to keep pace. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the point of going 50 km from the city and doing affordable homes when people can&rsquo;t commute?&rdquo; Dutt asked.</p><p>Despite tax benefits for developers, Dutt said the mismatch persists: capital remains expensive, land is scarce, and urban transport and roads are inadequate. The result is that affordable housing schemes stall or get pushed far from where people actually work.</p><p>With buyers shouldering nearly half their property cost in government-related fees and developers squeezed by high land and capital costs, Dutt&rsquo;s message was blunt: until land is unlocked and taxes rationalized, affordable housing will remain out of reach.</p></div><div><p><span>Published on: Sep 17, 2025 9:27 AM IST</span> </p></div></div></section>]]></description><pubDate>Thu, 18 Sep 2025 07:15:15 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1njd6gx/perspective_of_a_corporate_job_indian_muslim/</link><title>Perspective of a corporate job Indian Muslim, surviving India</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1njd6gx/perspective_of_a_corporate_job_indian_muslim/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1njd6gx/perspective_of_a_corporate_job_indian_muslim/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p>Reading time: 3 min | <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1njd6gx/perspective_of_a_corporate_job_indian_muslim/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='separator separator-after-permalink'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='selftext'><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone, I wanted to share something personal. A lot of people in the Hindu community might not really know what day-to-day life feels like for Muslims in India, especially those of us who are educated, working in MNCs, or just trying to get by. I’ll also touch on the lives of many who do self-employment or menial jobs.</p><p>For most Muslims, life is very middle class or lower middle class. It’s about making ends meet, sending kids to school, and hoping they get a better future. Just like most families across India. But neighborhoods with higher Muslim populations often face systematic neglect. Sewage systems remain unchanged for decades, overflowing every monsoon. Garbage collection is patchy at best, and residents often pay out of pocket to a garbage collection man. Power and utility management is overlooked. Slowly, a neighborhood becomes a slum — not because the people don’t care, but because the system doesn’t. And when residents complain, things rarely move once it’s tagged as a “Muslim area.”</p><p>Then comes college. An average Muslim student, just 18, wants nothing more than education and a chance to uplift his family. Instead, he hears taunts: <em>“jihadi,”</em> &quot;university ko bomb se uda de, sab pass ho jayenge&quot; <em>“bomb the university and we’ll all pass,”</em> &quot;tumhe to ISIS join karna tha na, yahan kya kar rahe ho&quot; <em>“why aren’t you joining ISIS?”</em> No matter how hard he tries to prove himself, in everyone&#39;s eyes he&#39;s already a terrorist/anti national, a man who can never really assimilate into the community.</p><p>If he pushes through and lands interviews, sometimes offers vanish once the recruiter or interviewer gets to know that the candidate is a muslim. Even when he gets the job, that’s not the end. Some seniors or colleagues throw underhanded or double meaning taunts and remarks or make the environment hostile. You can’t always report it either — because you risk losing the job and starting the discrimanatory process all over again. So you keep your head down, swallow the insults, and try to move on. Not all is bad though, some colleagues are wonderful and supportive — but it hurts when even they go silent when remarks on you get thrown around. You wish someone sided with you but nobody really does. So you have to take the insults and ignore it.</p><p>Then comes housing. Landlords reject you outright. Some do it subtly (<em>“only vegetarians allowed”</em>), others say it plainly. The ones who do agree often hike the rent 20–30%. Which leaves many Muslims stuck in the same neglected neighbourhoods they wanted to escape through education and jobs. Like a perpetual cycle</p><p>And when projects like the Halal Housing community in Mumbai are launched to give Muslims dignity and a cleaner environment, opposition rises instantly. It honestly feels like <em>“jeene bhi nahi denge, marne bhi nahi denge.”</em></p><p>From education, to work, to housing — each step forward pulls you back. That’s the survival of the common Muslim man in India. Not a threat. Not an enemy. Just someone trying to live, in the shadow of a hate-driven separatist environment created by the BJP.</p><p>Me and you — we’re not that different. We both want stability, dignity, and safety. So ask yourself: would you still believe that Muslims are a threat to this nation if you lived this life? Would you live a happy life in you were in my shoes and be proud that you were born in India ?</p><p>This isn’t a rant. It’s a perspective. An attempt to open a window into a life many don’t see.</p><p>Signing off. Take care.</p><p>*Since a lot of people are saying &quot;AI Slop/Chatgpt content&quot;, My actual passage was incredibly lengthy due to it being a lot more more heartfelt and emotional. I used Chatgpt to trim down the post for reddit because people usually scroll away when they see an incredibly long post.</p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section>]]></description><pubDate>Wed, 17 Sep 2025 18:58:30 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1njbfwz/i_genuninely_think_arrange_marrigess_are_bad_for/</link><title>I genuninely think Arrange Marriges's are BAD for India as a Whole.</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1njbfwz/i_genuninely_think_arrange_marrigess_are_bad_for/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1njbfwz/i_genuninely_think_arrange_marrigess_are_bad_for/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p>Reading time: 2 min | <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1njbfwz/i_genuninely_think_arrange_marrigess_are_bad_for/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='separator separator-after-permalink'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='selftext'><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Arrange marriages<br/>[typical Indian phenomenon where elders dictate or hold the deciding vote on life partners]<br/>are certainly not ideal.<br/>The idea of marrying a complete stranger itself gives me chills.</p><p>This practice also promotes negative things like dowry, caste restrictions, and limitation of choice.</p><p>Men &amp; Women would be more empowered, and instead of locking themselves into unhealthy or coerced marriages, they would have the freedom to make better choices for their own lives, instead of succumbing to parents’ pressure.</p><p>Also, without the system of arranged marriages, the average Indian man would have to genuinely work on himself his character, his career, his behavior if he wished to find a partner.<br/>That effort would naturally push him to improve and become a better human being &amp; learn to accept women as an equal human.

India is currently the third-largest supplier of seafood to the US.</p><p>Andhra Pradesh CM <a href="https://www.financialexpress.com/about/n-chandrababu-naidu/">N Chandrababu Naidu</a> has expressed the concern, according to PTI. &ldquo;The taxes imposed by America majorly hit shrimp exports. It is estimated that a loss of Rs 25,000 crore would have occurred. Up to 50 per cent export orders have been cancelled,&rdquo; said Naidu in his letters to the Central Ministers, according to an official press release on Sunday night.</p><h2><strong>Andhra Pradesh&rsquo;s dominant role in shrimp exports</strong></h2><p>The Chief Minister noted that Andhra Pradesh accounts for 80 per cent of India&rsquo;s shrimp exports and 34 per cent of marine exports, valued at around Rs 21,246 crore annually. The sector directly supports 2.5 lakh families, with another 30 lakh people involved in allied industries, Naidu said.</p><p>Naidu also pointed out that seafood consumption in India is far below than global levels, with per capita consumption at just 12-13 kg annually compared to the global average of 20-30 kg. To ease the crisis, the Andhra Pradesh government has persuaded aquaculture feed manufacturers to reduce prices by Rs 9 per kg and is considering supplying subsidised power transformers.</p><h2><strong>Andhra CM flags export losses</strong></h2><p>Naidu has requested the Centre to support the sector through measures such as boosting domestic consumption of aquaculture products, providing financial flexibility under <a href="https://www.financialexpress.com/about/gst/">GST</a>, and offering targeted financial assistance. He also proposed an Rs 100 crore corpus fund, the creation of cold storages, and hygienic fish and seafood markets.</p><p>He also urged the Centre to run dedicated trains to move aquaculture products from South India to other parts of the country and proposed a one-time top-up loan of Rs 1 lakh under Kisan Credit Cards for the fishing community.</p><h2><strong>CM writes to Union ministers seeking sector support</strong></h2><p>Naidu further called for strengthening processing, packaging, and cold-chain facilities to enhance competitiveness in new markets. He also requested the establishment of regional offices of key research institutions such as ICAR-CIBA and ICAR-NBFGR in Andhra Pradesh.</p><p>Naidu has sent separate letters to Union <a href="https://www.financialexpress.com/about/finance-minister/">Finance Minister</a> <a href="https://www.financialexpress.com/about/nirmala-sitharaman/">Nirmala Sitharaman</a>, Commerce Minister <a href="https://www.financialexpress.com/about/piyush-goyal/">Piyush Goyal</a> and Fisheries Minister Rajiv Ranjan Singh.</p></div></section>]]></description><pubDate>Wed, 17 Sep 2025 13:43:34 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1nj22ee/the_india_we_dont_notice_enough/</link><title>The India we don’t notice enough</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1nj22ee/the_india_we_dont_notice_enough/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1nj22ee/the_india_we_dont_notice_enough/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p>Reading time: 2 min | <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1nj22ee/the_india_we_dont_notice_enough/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='separator separator-after-permalink'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='selftext'><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>A few weeks ago, I was waiting at a roadside dhaba on NH-48 because my bus was delayed.
