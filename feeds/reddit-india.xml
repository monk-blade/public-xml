That is why I feel it is my duty to share the truth with you about what is really happening here.</p><p>You may have seen headlines claiming that Nepal is facing <strong>‚Äúmass protests led by Gen Z against social media ban.‚Äù</strong>That is only a half-truth.</p><p><strong>Here is the real sequence of events:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Three days ago, the Nepal government suddenly banned 26 social media platforms including Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, YouTube, and Reddit.</p></li><li><p>They claimed it was about registration and taxes. But these companies are already registered and paying taxes. The real motive is censorship: giving the government power to control online information, delete posts critical of them within 24 hours, and jail those who speak up.</p></li><li><p>In the next two days, criticism exploded across the country. A date was set‚ÄîSeptember 8‚Äîfor nationwide protests. But it was never just about social media. That ban was only the spark.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Our patience had already run out.</strong></p><p>Soon, the ‚Äú<strong>Nepo Babies</strong>‚Äù trend erupted in Nepal. It exposed the lavish lifestyles of politicians‚Äô children‚Äîdesigner (clothes,bags, watches, attire )worth lakhs, luxury cars, million-rupee homes, weekly international flights, and even private jets‚Äîwhile ordinary Nepalis struggle daily for survival. Our PM has a salary less than 65k INR but what is owns is in million of $$$.</p><blockquote><p>This hit a nerve. Because Nepal has been under one form of tyranny or another for decades. From monarchy to so-called democracy, corruption and instability have never left us. Not a single prime minister has completed a full term in over 20 years.</p></blockquote><p>[The protests were organized in the name of Gen Z, but they welcomed everyone. We were not just protesting a social media ban. We were standing against corruption, nepotism, tyranny, suppression, and decades of betrayal. In a country of just 30 million people, every single day around 5,000 youths leave to work abroad because there are no jobs, no decent pay, and no basic livelihood at home.]</p><p>And then the tragedy struck. Today, during the protest, I witnessed &amp; carried something I will never forget. A 15-year-old schoolboy, still in uniform, was shot in the head by security forces‚Äîacting on orders from a minister. He was not the only one. Reports say more than 20 people have been killed, thousands injured, and the true numbers are being hidden.</p><p>I came home with blood still on my hands, only to see Indian news channels spinning a completely false narrative. They claimed it was all about social media and mocked our youths as being ‚Äú<strong>addicted</strong>‚Äù to it. That angered me, but it didn‚Äôt surprise me. I know how the media can twist things.</p><p>That is why I am writing this here, to let you know the truth from the ground.</p><p>üôè</p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section>]]></description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Sep 2025 19:36:32 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1nblnic/living_in_india_is_just_exhausting_honestly/</link><title>Living in india is just exhausting honestly.</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1nblnic/living_in_india_is_just_exhausting_honestly/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1nblnic/living_in_india_is_just_exhausting_honestly/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p>Reading time: 2 min | <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1nblnic/living_in_india_is_just_exhausting_honestly/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='separator separator-after-permalink'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='selftext'><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Where do I even begin.

To qualify, applicants need fluency in Hindi, Indonesian, Spanish, or Portuguese, plus at least six years of experience in character creation, storytelling, and a working knowledge of prompt engineering.</p><p>In short, Meta isn&rsquo;t just looking for coders. It wants people who can design AI personalities that resonate across Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp.</p><p>These locally flavoured chatbots are part of CEO Mark Zuckerberg&rsquo;s grand plan to weave AI companions into the fabric of daily life. &ldquo;Over time, we'll find the vocabulary as a society to be able to articulate why that is valuable,&rdquo; he explained on a podcast earlier this year, suggesting bots could one day complement real-world friendships.</p><p>It&rsquo;s not Meta&rsquo;s first foray into AI-driven personalities. Back in 2023, the company rolled out a cast of alter-ego bots played by celebrities like Kendall Jenner, Snoop Dogg, and Tom Brady, a multimillion-dollar experiment that fizzled in under a year. By 2024, Meta had replaced that concept with AI Studio, a toolkit letting anyone create their own chatbot. Hundreds of these character-driven AIs now live on Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger, built not just by influencers but also by everyday users.</p><p>But while creator-built bots dominate the platforms, Meta clearly wants more control. Hiring contractors to shape region-specific personas signals a more hands-on approach, ensuring that its characters feel authentic to users in India, Indonesia, and beyond, rather than relying solely on what the community cooks up.</p><p>Still, building personalities comes with risks. A Reuters investigation revealed that Meta&rsquo;s rules once allowed its bots to flirt with teenagers, dish out dubious medical advice, and even generate racist content. That revelation prompted US senators to call for probes into how Meta manages its AI. Though the company has since tightened its guidelines, the episode underscored just how easily chatbots can veer into dangerous territory.</p><p>Privacy concerns have also cast a shadow. In August, Business Insider reported that contractors tasked with reviewing AI chats frequently stumbled across sensitive user data, names, phone numbers, emails, even selfies. Meta insisted it had &ldquo;strict policies and technical safeguards&rdquo; in place, but the leak potential is hard to ignore.</p><p>And then there are the eyebrow-raising personas themselves. In the US, some of the most notorious chatbots were called &ldquo;Russian Girl,&rdquo; &ldquo;Step Sister,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Step Mom&rdquo;, characters that users quickly discovered could slip into sexual roleplay. Their notoriety spread so far that even an OpenAI employee mocked Meta AI chief Alexandr Wang online, taking aim at the bizarre bot lineup.</p><p>In Indonesia, meanwhile, Business Insider found that two of the most popular characters were dubbed &ldquo;Lonely woman&rdquo; and &ldquo;Deviant male.&rdquo; While the outlet&rsquo;s own tests showed conversations stayed lighthearted rather than sexual, their popularity highlights the tightrope Meta must walk: offering engaging personalities without drifting into reputational minefields.</p><p>The new contract roles are being filled by staffing agencies. Listings spotted at Crystal Equation pointed to Hindi and Indonesian roles, while Aquent Talent advertised Spanish-language positions for what it coyly described as a &ldquo;top social media company&rdquo; headquartered in Menlo Park.</p><p>Overall, Meta isn&rsquo;t leaving the future of AI personalities to chance, or to celebrity experiments. It&rsquo;s investing in writers and cultural experts who can spin digital characters with just the right mix of charm, relatability, and local flavour. Whether that gamble pays off, or sparks fresh controversy, remains to be seen.</p><p>- Ends</p><div><div><p>Published By: </p><p>Unnati Gusain</p></div><div><p>Published On: </p><p>Sep 6, 2025</p></div></div></div></section>]]></description><pubDate>Sun, 07 Sep 2025 11:46:47 +0530</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
