It was around 1 AM, pitch dark outside except for the dim yellow bulbs at the stall. The owner was this middle-aged woman, hair tied in a bun, serving hot chai and parathas like it was the middle of the day.</p><p>I asked her, half out of curiosity, half out of guilt for keeping her busy so late:“Didi, aap raat bhar kaise kaam kar leti ho?”</p><p>She smiled and said, “Din mein toh aadhe customers truck waale hote hain jo raat ko hi chalte hain. Agar main raat ko band kar doon toh mera bachaon ka school kaise chalega?”</p><p>She pointed to a small corner where two kids, maybe 9 and 11, were asleep on a wooden bench, their school bags tucked like pillows under their heads.</p><p>Then she said something that just stopped me cold:“Main chahti hoon mere bachche kabhi raat ko jag kar kaam na karein. Unko jagna hai toh bas kitaab ke liye jagna hai.”</p><p>I didn’t even know how to respond. I just sat there, sipping the chai she made, feeling a mix of admiration and shame.</p><p>We talk so much about “India shining,” unicorn startups, billion-dollar valuations. But the truth is, the real backbone of this country is these unseen men and women who sacrifice sleep, comfort, and health so the next generation can dream bigger than they ever could.</p><p>That night I realized — privilege isn’t just money or city life. Privilege is being able to sleep peacefully at night, knowing you don’t have to sell chai at 2 AM so your kids can study.</p><p>Her words are still stuck in my head:“Unko jagna hai toh bas kitaab ke liye jagna hai.”</p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section>]]></description><pubDate>Wed, 17 Sep 2025 08:41:11 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.indiatoday.in/world/story/masood-azhar-family-killed-bahawalpur-operation-sindoor-jaish-commander-admits-2788096-2025-09-16</link><title>Masood Azhar's family 'torn into pieces' by India: Jaish admits Op Sindoor impact.

According to the PCB, Pycroft had specifically instructed Salman to refrain from shaking hands.</p><p>&ldquo;The match referee Andy Pycroft had asked captain Salman Ali Agha, at the time of the toss, not to shake hands with his Indian counterpart. The Pakistan team management has lodged a protest, calling the behaviour against the spirit of sports,&rdquo; the board said.<span></span>The situation worsened after India&rsquo;s emphatic seven-wicket win, when Suryakumar shook hands only with batting partner Shivam Dube and walked off without acknowledging the Pakistani players. </p><p>Pakistan coach Mike Hesson voiced his disappointment.&ldquo;Obviously, we were ready to shake hands at the end of the game. We were disappointed that our opposition didn't do that. We sort of went over there to shake hands and they were already going to the changing room. That was a disappointing way for the match to end.

After months of railing against India for buying Russian oil and hammering New Delhi with punitive tariffs, the US president is now training his guns on China. In his latest Truth Social post, Trump thundered that Nato nations must "stop buying oil from Russia" and unite to<strong><a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/world/story/ready-to-do-major-sanctions-on-russia-when-all-nato-nations-agree-and-do-the-same-thing-says-trump-2786834-2025-09-13"> impose "major sanctions" on Moscow </a></strong>&ndash; while also calling for devastating 50 per cent to 100 per cent tariffs on Beijing.</p><p>In a fiery letter addressed to Nato members and "the world", Trump declared: "I am ready to do major sanctions on Russia when all Nato nations have agreed, and started, to do the same thing, and when all Nato Nations STOP BUYING OIL FROM RUSSIA. As you know, Nato's commitment to win has been far less than 100 per cent, and the purchase of Russian Oil, by some, has been shocking! It greatly weakens your negotiating position, and bargaining power, over Russia."</p><p>Trump urged the alliance to act collectively, insisting he was prepared to "go" once Nato members align on sanctions: "Anyway, I am ready to 'go' when you are. Just say when?" he wrote.</p><p>In his most direct remarks yet, Trump said he is "ready" to move on the sanctions, which could have a devastating impact on Russia's finances &ndash; but ultimately left the decision in the hands of Nato allies.</p><p>The sharpest edge of his demand, though, was reserved for Beijing. "I believe that this, plus Nato , as a group, placing 50 per cent to 100 per cent TARIFFS ON CHINA, to be fully withdrawn after the WAR with Russia and Ukraine is ended, will also be of great help in ENDING this deadly, but RIDICULOUS, WAR," he added.</p><p>Trump stressed that "China has a strong control, and even grip, over Russia, and these powerful Tariffs will break that grip".</p><h3>TRUMP SHIFTS HIS ATTENTION TO CHINA</h3><p><strong><a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/donald-trump-softening-stance-india-ties-tariff-trade-deal-after-harsh-criticism-2781316-2025-09-03">The demand marks a stark reversal</a></strong>: until recently, Trump had spared China with a lighter 30 per cent tariff while punishing India with a bruising 50 per cent duty, often lumping the two in the same breath as Moscow's biggest enablers.</p><p>After US President Donald Trump pressed Nato nations to impose tariffs on Russian oil purchasers in a bid to pressure Moscow, China on Saturday said that it <strong><a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/world/story/china-hits-back-at-trump-100-per-cent-tariff-call-india-sanctions-russia-ukraine-war-2786934-2025-09-13">neither plots nor participates in wars</a></strong>, in a stern and clear message to Washington.</p><p>Beijing's dig at the US came just hours after Trump's post urging Nato members to halt Russian oil purchases and impose sanctions of up to 100 per cent on China, one of Moscow's biggest buyers.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/world/story/g7-finance-ministers-discuss-tariffs-possible-sanctions-to-increase-pressure-on-russia-glbs-2786586-2025-09-13">Additionally, the US has been urging G7 countries</a></strong> &ndash; including Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom, most of whom are also Nato members &ndash; to step up pressure on Russia by imposing tariffs on India and China, both major buyers of Russian oil.</p><p>This shift in target comes after weeks of acrimony in India-US ties. Washington had unleashed some of its harshest rhetoric in decades, with Trump aides branding India the "Kremlin's laundromat" and even <strong><a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/world/us-news/story/modis-war-white-house-adviser-navarro-links-india-to-ukraine-war-glbs-2777904-2025-08-28">dismissing the Russia-Ukraine conflict as "Modi's war".</a></strong></p><p>Trade advisor Peter Navarro went further, lacing his attacks with casteist undertones by accusing "Brahmins" of profiteering at the expense of ordinary Indians.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/world/story/weve-lost-india-russia-to-darkest-china-trump-shares-pic-of-modi-putin-xi-together-from-sco-summit-2782533-2025-09-05">Trump himself grumbled that the US had "lost" India to "the darkest China" </a></strong>after images from the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit showed Prime Minister Narendra Modi chatting amiably with Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin.</p><p>The optics of the SCO summit clearly rattled Washington. PM Modi's visible camaraderie with Putin &ndash; walking hand-in-hand, holding candid conversations, even sharing a car ride in Tianjin &ndash; and his warm exchanges with Xi, symbolised a deepening comfort between the world's three biggest powers.</p><p>For a US administration banking on India as the democratic counterweight to China, the sight of New Delhi leaning on Moscow and Beijing through multilateral forums was nothing short of alarming.</p><p>India's firmness has only added to Washington's unease. Despite the barrage of US criticism, New Delhi has refused to yield on what it considers red lines &ndash; particularly opening its dairy and agricultural sectors, which could devastate millions of farmers.</p><p>Trump's imposition of a 25 per cent tariff on Indian goods and an additional 25 per cent penalty over Russian oil imports deepened the chill, and stalled trade talks languished in deadlock. Yet, the government held its ground, signalling that no amount of hectoring would shake India's stance.</p><p>Faced with that resolve &ndash; and the nightmare scenario of India, China, and Russia banding together, Washington has begun to soften its tone.</p><p>Last week, Trump abruptly changed tack, calling <strong><a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/world/us-news/story/will-speak-to-pm-modi-trump-says-india-us-to-continue-trade-talks-glbs-2784767-2025-09-10">PM Modi a "great Prime Minister" and a "dear friend"</a></strong>. PM Modi reciprocated swiftly, describing the US as a "close friend and natural partner", and expressing confidence that the trade negotiations would soon unlock the <strong><a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/india-us-natural-partners-pm-modi-says-he-too-is-looking-forward-to-speaking-with-president-trump-2784778-2025-09-10">"limitless potential" of the partnership.</a></strong></p><h3>REASON BEHIND WASHINGTON'S RECALIBRATION</h3><p>Trump's lieutenants, too, have recalibrated. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who<strong><a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/world/us-news/story/scott-bessent-backs-us-india-ties-hits-russian-oil-trade-glbs-2780400-2025-09-02"> once led the charge against India's Russian oil purchases</a></strong>, now plays the conciliator.</p><p>"Two great countries will get this solved," he said, emphasising the personal rapport between Trump and PM Modi. Even he brushed off SCO optics as manageable, though conceding that the relationship was "very complicated." By contrast, Navarro has continued his barrage &ndash; but his vitriol now looks increasingly isolated.</p><p>The reasons for this pivot are both external and domestic. At home, Trump has been hammered by Democrats, former officials, and even Republican rivals like Nikki Haley for imperilling two decades of painstakingly built ties with India. Alienating Indian-Americans &ndash; a demographic increasingly warming to Trump &ndash; also carries political risks. Abroad, the idea of India tilting closer to China and Russia is a strategic nightmare that the US can ill afford.</p><p>By shifting the spotlight to Beijing, Trump is signalling a recalibration: China, with its USD 7.2 billion purchase of Russian fossil fuels in July and its "grip" over Moscow, is the real prize. India, with its USD 3.6 billion in imports and an <strong><a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/india-us-trade-talks-agriculture-dairy-sector-donald-trump-explain-bilateral-trade-gm-crops-subsidy-explained-2749828-2025-07-03">uncompromising government unwilling to bend on trade red lines</a></strong>, has effectively forced Washington's hand.</p><p>The softer tone towards New Delhi and the tougher rhetoric against Beijing reveal a US strategy in transition &ndash; one that acknowledges India's leverage and the costs of pushing it further into the arms of Moscow and Beijing.</p><p>For now, Trump insists he is "ready" to devastate Russia's finances with sanctions &ndash; but only when Nato nations unite and stop buying Russian oil. More telling, though, is his demand that China face up to 100 per cent tariffs. In Trump's calculus, sparing India and targeting Beijing may be the only way to break what he calls China's "grip" over Russia &ndash; and to ensure that America does not lose India for good.</p><p>- Ends</p><div><div><p>Published By: </p><p>Nakul Ahuja</p></div><div><p>Published On: </p><p>Sep 14, 2025</p></div></div><p>Tune In</p></div><div class="gallery"><p><img src="https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/author/Nakul-profile_image_one_to_one.jpeg?VersionId=38FoOGLj4yavzOeKV44CGYATC92xdZir&amp;size=50:50"></p></div></section>]]></description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 14:58:52 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/missing-truck-driver-rescued-from-sacked-ias-officer-puja-khedkars-pune-home-9276453?pfrom=home-ndtv_topscroll</link><title>Missing Truck Driver Rescued From Sacked IAS Officer Puja Khedkar's Pune Home (ndtv.com)</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1ngx3gf/missing_truck_driver_rescued_from_sacked_ias/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1ngx3gf/missing_truck_driver_rescued_from_sacked_ias/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1ngx3gf/missing_truck_driver_rescued_from_sacked_ias/'>Post permalink</a></p></section>]]></description><pubDate>Sun, 14 Sep 2025 22:50:14 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/sikh-woman-raped-by-2-men-in-uk-oldbury-told-go-back-to-your-country-9269438</link><title>"Go Back To Your Country": Sikh Woman Raped, Faced Racist Abuse In UK (ndtv.com)</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1nguaow/go_back_to_your_country_sikh_woman_raped_faced/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1nguaow/go_back_to_your_country_sikh_woman_raped_faced/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1nguaow/go_back_to_your_country_sikh_woman_raped_faced/'>Post permalink</a></p></section>]]></description><pubDate>Sun, 14 Sep 2025 21:02:23 +0530</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
