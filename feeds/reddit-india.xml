A lot of people in the Hindu community might not really know what day-to-day life feels like for Muslims in India, especially those of us who are educated, working in MNCs, or just trying to get by. I’ll also touch on the lives of many who do self-employment or menial jobs.</p><p>For most Muslims, life is very middle class or lower middle class. It’s about making ends meet, sending kids to school, and hoping they get a better future. Just like most families across India. But neighborhoods with higher Muslim populations often face systematic neglect. Sewage systems remain unchanged for decades, overflowing every monsoon. Garbage collection is patchy at best, and residents often pay out of pocket to a garbage collection man. Power and utility management is overlooked. Slowly, a neighborhood becomes a slum — not because the people don’t care, but because the system doesn’t. And when residents complain, things rarely move once it’s tagged as a “Muslim area.”</p><p>Then comes college. An average Muslim student, just 18, wants nothing more than education and a chance to uplift his family. Instead, he hears taunts: <em>“jihadi,”</em> &quot;university ko bomb se uda de, sab pass ho jayenge&quot; <em>“bomb the university and we’ll all pass,”</em> &quot;tumhe to ISIS join karna tha na, yahan kya kar rahe ho&quot; <em>“why aren’t you joining ISIS?”</em> No matter how hard he tries to prove himself, in everyone&#39;s eyes he&#39;s already a terrorist/anti national, a man who can never really assimilate into the community.</p><p>If he pushes through and lands interviews, sometimes offers vanish once the recruiter or interviewer gets to know that the candidate is a muslim. Even when he gets the job, that’s not the end. Some seniors or colleagues throw underhanded or double meaning taunts and remarks or make the environment hostile. You can’t always report it either — because you risk losing the job and starting the discrimanatory process all over again. So you keep your head down, swallow the insults, and try to move on. Not all is bad though, some colleagues are wonderful and supportive — but it hurts when even they go silent when remarks on you get thrown around. You wish someone sided with you but nobody really does. So you have to take the insults and ignore it.</p><p>Then comes housing. Landlords reject you outright. Some do it subtly (<em>“only vegetarians allowed”</em>), others say it plainly. The ones who do agree often hike the rent 20–30%. Which leaves many Muslims stuck in the same neglected neighbourhoods they wanted to escape through education and jobs. Like a perpetual cycle</p><p>And when projects like the Halal Housing community in Mumbai are launched to give Muslims dignity and a cleaner environment, opposition rises instantly. It honestly feels like <em>“jeene bhi nahi denge, marne bhi nahi denge.”</em></p><p>From education, to work, to housing — each step forward pulls you back. That’s the survival of the common Muslim man in India. Not a threat. Not an enemy. Just someone trying to live, in the shadow of a hate-driven separatist environment created by the BJP.</p><p>Me and you — we’re not that different. We both want stability, dignity, and safety. So ask yourself: would you still believe that Muslims are a threat to this nation if you lived this life? Would you live a happy life in you were in my shoes and be proud that you were born in India ?</p><p>This isn’t a rant. It’s a perspective. An attempt to open a window into a life many don’t see.</p><p>Signing off. Take care.</p><p>*Since a lot of people are saying &quot;AI Slop/Chatgpt content&quot;, My actual passage was incredibly lengthy due to it being a lot more more heartfelt and emotional. I used Chatgpt to trim down the post for reddit because people usually scroll away when they see an incredibly long post.</p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section>]]></description><pubDate>Wed, 17 Sep 2025 18:58:30 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1nj22ee/the_india_we_dont_notice_enough/</link><title>The India we don’t notice enough</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1nj22ee/the_india_we_dont_notice_enough/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1nj22ee/the_india_we_dont_notice_enough/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p>Reading time: 2 min | <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1nj22ee/the_india_we_dont_notice_enough/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='separator separator-after-permalink'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='selftext'><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>A few weeks ago, I was waiting at a roadside dhaba on NH-48 because my bus was delayed. It was around 1 AM, pitch dark outside except for the dim yellow bulbs at the stall. The owner was this middle-aged woman, hair tied in a bun, serving hot chai and parathas like it was the middle of the day.</p><p>I asked her, half out of curiosity, half out of guilt for keeping her busy so late:“Didi, aap raat bhar kaise kaam kar leti ho?”</p><p>She smiled and said, “Din mein toh aadhe customers truck waale hote hain jo raat ko hi chalte hain. Agar main raat ko band kar doon toh mera bachaon ka school kaise chalega?”</p><p>She pointed to a small corner where two kids, maybe 9 and 11, were asleep on a wooden bench, their school bags tucked like pillows under their heads.</p><p>Then she said something that just stopped me cold:“Main chahti hoon mere bachche kabhi raat ko jag kar kaam na karein. Unko jagna hai toh bas kitaab ke liye jagna hai.”</p><p>I didn’t even know how to respond. I just sat there, sipping the chai she made, feeling a mix of admiration and shame.</p><p>We talk so much about “India shining,” unicorn startups, billion-dollar valuations. But the truth is, the real backbone of this country is these unseen men and women who sacrifice sleep, comfort, and health so the next generation can dream bigger than they ever could.</p><p>That night I realized — privilege isn’t just money or city life. Privilege is being able to sleep peacefully at night, knowing you don’t have to sell chai at 2 AM so your kids can study.</p><p>Her words are still stuck in my head:“Unko jagna hai toh bas kitaab ke liye jagna hai.”</p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section>]]></description><pubDate>Wed, 17 Sep 2025 08:41:11 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://thewire.in/communalism/muslim-teens-suicide-spotlights-gujarats-controversial-disturbed-areas-act</link><title>Muslim Teen's Suicide Spotlights Gujarat's Controversial Disturbed Areas Act (thewire.in)</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1nicpd0/muslim_teens_suicide_spotlights_gujarats/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1nicpd0/muslim_teens_suicide_spotlights_gujarats/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1nicpd0/muslim_teens_suicide_spotlights_gujarats/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='preview-image'><img src='https://cms.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/WhatsApp-Image-2025-09-02-at-15.07.06-1.jpeg' /></section>]]></description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 14:55:41 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.businesstoday.in/india/story/mugging-up-random-trivia-for-500-seats-founder-slams-upsc-iit-system-for-killing-talent-494110-2025-09-16</link><title>'Mugging up random trivia for 500 seats': Founder slams UPSC, IIT system for killing talent (businesstoday.in)</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1ni90np/mugging_up_random_trivia_for_500_seats_founder/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1ni90np/mugging_up_random_trivia_for_500_seats_founder/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p>Reading time: 2 min | <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1ni90np/mugging_up_random_trivia_for_500_seats_founder/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='separator separator-before-parsed-content'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='parsed-content'><h2>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not just unfair.

After months of railing against India for buying Russian oil and hammering New Delhi with punitive tariffs, the US president is now training his guns on China. In his latest Truth Social post, Trump thundered that Nato nations must "stop buying oil from Russia" and unite to<strong><a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/world/story/ready-to-do-major-sanctions-on-russia-when-all-nato-nations-agree-and-do-the-same-thing-says-trump-2786834-2025-09-13"> impose "major sanctions" on Moscow </a></strong>&ndash; while also calling for devastating 50 per cent to 100 per cent tariffs on Beijing.</p><p>In a fiery letter addressed to Nato members and "the world", Trump declared: "I am ready to do major sanctions on Russia when all Nato nations have agreed, and started, to do the same thing, and when all Nato Nations STOP BUYING OIL FROM RUSSIA. As you know, Nato's commitment to win has been far less than 100 per cent, and the purchase of Russian Oil, by some, has been shocking! It greatly weakens your negotiating position, and bargaining power, over Russia."</p><p>Trump urged the alliance to act collectively, insisting he was prepared to "go" once Nato members align on sanctions: "Anyway, I am ready to 'go' when you are. Just say when?" he wrote.</p><p>In his most direct remarks yet, Trump said he is "ready" to move on the sanctions, which could have a devastating impact on Russia's finances &ndash; but ultimately left the decision in the hands of Nato allies.</p><p>The sharpest edge of his demand, though, was reserved for Beijing. "I believe that this, plus Nato , as a group, placing 50 per cent to 100 per cent TARIFFS ON CHINA, to be fully withdrawn after the WAR with Russia and Ukraine is ended, will also be of great help in ENDING this deadly, but RIDICULOUS, WAR," he added.</p><p>Trump stressed that "China has a strong control, and even grip, over Russia, and these powerful Tariffs will break that grip".</p><h3>TRUMP SHIFTS HIS ATTENTION TO CHINA</h3><p><strong><a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/donald-trump-softening-stance-india-ties-tariff-trade-deal-after-harsh-criticism-2781316-2025-09-03">The demand marks a stark reversal</a></strong>: until recently, Trump had spared China with a lighter 30 per cent tariff while punishing India with a bruising 50 per cent duty, often lumping the two in the same breath as Moscow's biggest enablers.</p><p>After US President Donald Trump pressed Nato nations to impose tariffs on Russian oil purchasers in a bid to pressure Moscow, China on Saturday said that it <strong><a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/world/story/china-hits-back-at-trump-100-per-cent-tariff-call-india-sanctions-russia-ukraine-war-2786934-2025-09-13">neither plots nor participates in wars</a></strong>, in a stern and clear message to Washington.</p><p>Beijing's dig at the US came just hours after Trump's post urging Nato members to halt Russian oil purchases and impose sanctions of up to 100 per cent on China, one of Moscow's biggest buyers.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/world/story/g7-finance-ministers-discuss-tariffs-possible-sanctions-to-increase-pressure-on-russia-glbs-2786586-2025-09-13">Additionally, the US has been urging G7 countries</a></strong> &ndash; including Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom, most of whom are also Nato members &ndash; to step up pressure on Russia by imposing tariffs on India and China, both major buyers of Russian oil.</p><p>This shift in target comes after weeks of acrimony in India-US ties. Washington had unleashed some of its harshest rhetoric in decades, with Trump aides branding India the "Kremlin's laundromat" and even <strong><a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/world/us-news/story/modis-war-white-house-adviser-navarro-links-india-to-ukraine-war-glbs-2777904-2025-08-28">dismissing the Russia-Ukraine conflict as "Modi's war".</a></strong></p><p>Trade advisor Peter Navarro went further, lacing his attacks with casteist undertones by accusing "Brahmins" of profiteering at the expense of ordinary Indians.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/world/story/weve-lost-india-russia-to-darkest-china-trump-shares-pic-of-modi-putin-xi-together-from-sco-summit-2782533-2025-09-05">Trump himself grumbled that the US had "lost" India to "the darkest China" </a></strong>after images from the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit showed Prime Minister Narendra Modi chatting amiably with Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin.</p><p>The optics of the SCO summit clearly rattled Washington. PM Modi's visible camaraderie with Putin &ndash; walking hand-in-hand, holding candid conversations, even sharing a car ride in Tianjin &ndash; and his warm exchanges with Xi, symbolised a deepening comfort between the world's three biggest powers.</p><p>For a US administration banking on India as the democratic counterweight to China, the sight of New Delhi leaning on Moscow and Beijing through multilateral forums was nothing short of alarming.</p><p>India's firmness has only added to Washington's unease. Despite the barrage of US criticism, New Delhi has refused to yield on what it considers red lines &ndash; particularly opening its dairy and agricultural sectors, which could devastate millions of farmers.</p><p>Trump's imposition of a 25 per cent tariff on Indian goods and an additional 25 per cent penalty over Russian oil imports deepened the chill, and stalled trade talks languished in deadlock. Yet, the government held its ground, signalling that no amount of hectoring would shake India's stance.</p><p>Faced with that resolve &ndash; and the nightmare scenario of India, China, and Russia banding together, Washington has begun to soften its tone.</p><p>Last week, Trump abruptly changed tack, calling <strong><a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/world/us-news/story/will-speak-to-pm-modi-trump-says-india-us-to-continue-trade-talks-glbs-2784767-2025-09-10">PM Modi a "great Prime Minister" and a "dear friend"</a></strong>. PM Modi reciprocated swiftly, describing the US as a "close friend and natural partner", and expressing confidence that the trade negotiations would soon unlock the <strong><a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/india-us-natural-partners-pm-modi-says-he-too-is-looking-forward-to-speaking-with-president-trump-2784778-2025-09-10">"limitless potential" of the partnership.</a></strong></p><h3>REASON BEHIND WASHINGTON'S RECALIBRATION</h3><p>Trump's lieutenants, too, have recalibrated. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who<strong><a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/world/us-news/story/scott-bessent-backs-us-india-ties-hits-russian-oil-trade-glbs-2780400-2025-09-02"> once led the charge against India's Russian oil purchases</a></strong>, now plays the conciliator.</p><p>"Two great countries will get this solved," he said, emphasising the personal rapport between Trump and PM Modi. Even he brushed off SCO optics as manageable, though conceding that the relationship was "very complicated." By contrast, Navarro has continued his barrage &ndash; but his vitriol now looks increasingly isolated.</p><p>The reasons for this pivot are both external and domestic. At home, Trump has been hammered by Democrats, former officials, and even Republican rivals like Nikki Haley for imperilling two decades of painstakingly built ties with India. Alienating Indian-Americans &ndash; a demographic increasingly warming to Trump &ndash; also carries political risks. Abroad, the idea of India tilting closer to China and Russia is a strategic nightmare that the US can ill afford.</p><p>By shifting the spotlight to Beijing, Trump is signalling a recalibration: China, with its USD 7.2 billion purchase of Russian fossil fuels in July and its "grip" over Moscow, is the real prize. India, with its USD 3.6 billion in imports and an <strong><a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/india-us-trade-talks-agriculture-dairy-sector-donald-trump-explain-bilateral-trade-gm-crops-subsidy-explained-2749828-2025-07-03">uncompromising government unwilling to bend on trade red lines</a></strong>, has effectively forced Washington's hand.</p><p>The softer tone towards New Delhi and the tougher rhetoric against Beijing reveal a US strategy in transition &ndash; one that acknowledges India's leverage and the costs of pushing it further into the arms of Moscow and Beijing.</p><p>For now, Trump insists he is "ready" to devastate Russia's finances with sanctions &ndash; but only when Nato nations unite and stop buying Russian oil. More telling, though, is his demand that China face up to 100 per cent tariffs. In Trump's calculus, sparing India and targeting Beijing may be the only way to break what he calls China's "grip" over Russia &ndash; and to ensure that America does not lose India for good.</p><p>- Ends</p><div><div><p>Published By: </p><p>Nakul Ahuja</p></div><div><p>Published On: </p><p>Sep 14, 2025</p></div></div><p>Tune In</p></div><div class="gallery"><p><img src="https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/author/Nakul-profile_image_one_to_one.jpeg?VersionId=38FoOGLj4yavzOeKV44CGYATC92xdZir&amp;size=50:50"></p></div></section>]]></description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 14:58:52 +0530</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
