He’s 29, works in a good MNC, earns enough to pay rent and send some money home. On paper, he’s doing fine. But that night he said something that hit me like a brick:</p><p>&quot;My dad keeps asking me why I don’t buy a flat. My boss keeps asking me why I don’t put in more hours if I want a promotion. My relatives keep asking me why I’m not married yet. My friends keep asking me why I’m not chasing my passion. And honestly… I don’t know who I’m disappointing more, them or myself.&quot;</p><p>He told me how his father bought land and built a house before 30. But for him, even with a good salary, EMI for a 2BHK feels like a trap. His dad doesn’t get it, because in his time, hard work guaranteed progress. In ours, hard work only guarantees survival.</p><p>He said he wants to quit and travel, maybe work on something creative. But then his younger cousins laugh at him for “dreaming too small” when they’re already coding, trading crypto, and chasing millions.</p><p>That night, he just sat there crying quietly, saying: “I’m stuck between two worlds. I’m not bold enough for the new one, not traditional enough for the old one. And I don’t know where I fit anymore.”</p><p>I didn’t know what to say. Because deep down, I knew he wasn’t just speaking for himself. He was speaking for all of us, this entire generation that grew up with dial-up internet but now lives in hyper-speed 5G. A generation that was told to “play it safe” but also to “dream big.” A generation that’s exhausted from trying to live two different lives at once.</p><p>And maybe that’s why so many of us are anxious, restless, sleepless. Because we’re carrying expectations from two different Indias, one that doesn’t exist anymore, and one we’re not sure we belong to.</p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section>]]></description><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2025 18:03:12 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1n8z9oj/jee_has_ruined_engineering_in_india/</link><title>JEE has ruined engineering in India</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1n8z9oj/jee_has_ruined_engineering_in_india/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1n8z9oj/jee_has_ruined_engineering_in_india/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p>Reading time: 2 min | <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1n8z9oj/jee_has_ruined_engineering_in_india/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='separator separator-after-permalink'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='selftext'><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>jee has ruined engineering in india. it has killed creativity and turned the whole thing into a rat race where the only skill that matters is mugging up formulas and solving the same pattern of problems. i’m a software engineer and it makes me sick watching kids who started coding at 12 or 13 and had so much potential just lose it all once they get sucked into the jee grinder. they stop building projects, stop experimenting &amp; stop being curious because none of that matters in jee.</p><p>the result is obvious. no indian college is anywhere near the top in qs rankings. not a single indian university shows up in the top 50 of icpc, the most important competition for competitive programmers worldwide. years of coaching and hype and the “best minds” of india cannot even break into the top bracket globally.</p><p>jee is a psyop to keep the middle class middle class. it eats away years of their youth, drains their parents’ savings and then spits them out into overcrowded colleges with mediocre teaching. and don&#39;t get me started on how btech professors themselves don&#39;t know how new frameworks &amp; new technologies work, most continue this outdated chalk and talk method, recycling the same 20 year old notes, teaching students c and java like it’s still 2005 while the real industry has already moved on. they’ve never built a real project, never shipped code, never touched the tools companies actually use, but they’ll grade you on theory exams and make you feel like you’re not good enough. it’s a joke.</p><p>the coaching mafia has made billions selling this dream. kota is basically a factory farm where kids are treated like products. they don’t care if you burn out or die, as long as the fees keep rolling in and they can plaster a few toppers on billboards.</p><p>this is what happens when you worship an exam instead of actual learning. jee has turned engineering into a factory that produces unskilled degree holders not engineers. </p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section>]]></description><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2025 13:32:09 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1n8ytgc/why_is_our_culture_so_harsh_towards_women/</link><title>Why is our culture so harsh towards women?</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1n8ytgc/why_is_our_culture_so_harsh_towards_women/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1n8ytgc/why_is_our_culture_so_harsh_towards_women/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p>Reading time: 4 min | <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1n8ytgc/why_is_our_culture_so_harsh_towards_women/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='separator separator-after-permalink'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='selftext'><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>1.Have you ever wondered why, given that Lord Ram was also away from his wife, just Mata Sita was required to grant the agni pariksha? Why Mata Sita was the only one who needed to prove herself when they finally met? Even when we all know that lord Rama ate Sabri k juthe ber . Only a person in love can eat someones leftover food (Koi pyaar mein hi kisi ka jutha kha sakta hai) . Women from forest were generally beautiful in those days . They used to eat fruits , nuts , vegetables but scriptures showed that she was a old crippled women so that nobody questions any further about the incident. Why are women&#39;s morals usually questioned? </p><p>The wisdom of the crowd is often less than that of an individual. When you recognize that your wife is divine, there&#39;s no room for further doubt. And if you do question her, then have the courage to walk through the fire alongside her—hand in hand—and prove your own purity too, for you were apart from her just as long.</p><p>2.In the Mahabharata, Pandav gambled and kept their bride, Mata Draupadi, on the line. Following the public stripping of her garments, her five husbands, along with other dignitaries like Bhism, Guru Dronacharya, and many more, chose to remain silent. Imagine the wife was used as a scapegoat for the husband&#39;s avarice for the crown . She was even divided among five brothers. When one was with her in the room they used to keep their footwear outside so that others can understand that one of the brother is having his turn .They didn&#39;t even ask her what she wanted. Imagine what kind of scriptures we follow .</p><p>3.A man will be referred to as a Buddha if he leaves his home, wife, and children to enter the forest, while a woman&#39;s character will be questioned by society if she leaves her home, children, and husband to enter the forest. But u know what we women won&#39;t do that we don&#39;t run away from responsibility. </p><p>4.Even in Jainism, it is said that women cannot achieve moksha, or liberation from the cycle of life and death. To achieve moksha, you must have another birth as a man and then follow the digambar Jain route walking naked, pulling your hair . What a philosophy, wow. Seems like women body is the only problem.</p><p>5.In Islam first of all women must, cover her face and entire body when she is in public. Second, she is prohibited from entering the mosque since women&#39;s bowing during prayer can divert the attention of other men. She must follow the nikah halala procedure, which requires her to have physical relation with another person by getting married to them, if she wishes to get back to her 1st husband after her spouse has divorced her. After this second person gives divorce, she is free to go back to her original husband. Why only women have to go through this bogus custom? Prophet marrying several times declaring Polygamy as sunnath . This is worst religion for a women to be in where she is treated as machine to produce childrens. They don&#39;t even allow their women to study. She is just a slave to the husband.</p><p>If this is our belief system and the culture we come from, then nothing will ever change in this modern era. In many modern households, the mother-in-law has passed down the same outdated mindset to her daughter-in-law—a mindset she inherited from her own mother-in-law—that a woman’s sole purpose is to produce a male child. Shockingly, this still happens even in educated families, despite knowing that the gender of the child is determined by the male’s sperm (through the XY chromosomes). Yet, women are still blamed and made to feel guilty. If a woman is unable to conceive or gives birth to a girl instead of a boy, she is often harshly criticized and treated as if she has failed. What’s worse is that this pressure and cruelty often come from another woman—the mother-in-law—who fails to empathize, even though she is a woman herself . </p><p>When two men fight, they often insult each other by using offensive language about each other&#39;s mothers and sisters. But what have those women done to deserve such disrespect? And yet, these same people claim that we Hindus treat women as goddesses as Devis. Really? These are the very people who didn’t allow women to enter temples during their menstrual cycles—who went so far as to question something as natural and sacred as menstruation, which is the very foundation of human existence.</p><p>Do you really think education can bring equality and respect for women ? Because I don&#39;t think so .</p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section>]]></description><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2025 13:01:47 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.businesstoday.in/india/story/indias-fertility-rate-falls-below-replacement-level-even-as-population-hits-146-bn-un-report-492664-2025-09-05</link><title>India's fertility rate falls below replacement level even as population hits 1.46 bn: UN report (businesstoday.in)</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1n8x2sr/indias_fertility_rate_falls_below_replacement/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1n8x2sr/indias_fertility_rate_falls_below_replacement/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p>Reading time: 2 min | <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1n8x2sr/indias_fertility_rate_falls_below_replacement/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='preview-image'><img src='https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/businesstoday/images/story/202509/68ba5a6acd041-indias-population-grows-to-146-billion--experts-stress-informed-family-planning-over-panic-05350144-16x9.png' /></section><section class='parsed-content'><h2>The report projects that India&rsquo;s population will peak at around 1.7 billion over the next 40 years before starting to shrink</h2><div><div><p>India&rsquo;s population has reached 1.46 billion in 2025, overtaking China to become the world&rsquo;s most populous nation, even as its fertility rate continues to decline, according to the United Nations Population Fund&rsquo;s (UNFPA) State of World Population Report released on Tuesday.</p><p>The report projects that India&rsquo;s population will peak at around 1.7 billion over the next 40 years before starting to shrink. In comparison, China&rsquo;s population is estimated at 1.41 billion this year. Last year, India&rsquo;s population stood at 1.44 billion, according to the World Population Prospects 2024 report released by the UN in July.</p><p>India&rsquo;s total fertility rate (TFR) has now fallen to 1.9, below the replacement level of 2.1 required to maintain a stable population across generations. The UNFPA report notes that while the national average reflects progress, stark disparities persist across regions, economic classes, and social groups.</p><p>The report identifies a &ldquo;high fertility and low fertility duality.&rdquo; States such as Bihar, Jharkhand, and Uttar Pradesh continue to have high fertility rates due to poor access to contraception, limited healthcare services, and entrenched gender norms. In contrast, Delhi, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu have sustained below-replacement fertility levels, where urban, educated middle-class couples are delaying or opting out of parenthood due to rising costs and work-life pressures.</p><p>Over the decades, India has seen a major decline in fertility, from nearly five children per woman in 1970 to around two today. The National Family Health Survey of 2019&ndash;21 recorded a TFR of 2.0 for the first time, signalling a shift below replacement level.</p><p>Despite these gains, millions of Indians still face barriers to making informed reproductive choices. &ldquo;This is the real crisis, not underpopulation or overpopulation. The answer lies in greater reproductive agency, a person's ability to make free and informed choices about sex, contraception and starting a family,&rdquo; the UNFPA report states.</p><p>A UNFPA-YouGov survey of 14,000 people across 14 countries, including India, found that one in three Indian adults experienced unintended pregnancies. Another 30 percent reported being unable to have as many or as few children as they wanted, while 23 percent faced both challenges. Financial constraints were the most cited barrier, followed by job insecurity (21 percent), housing issues (22 percent), and lack of access to reliable childcare (18 percent).</p></div><div><p><span>Published on: Sep 5, 2025 9:11 AM IST</span> </p></div></div></section>]]></description><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2025 11:12:28 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1n8dtaa/friend_22_died_under_suspicious_circumstances_in/</link><title>Friend (22) died under suspicious circumstances in Delhi.
