But new research suggests that keeping score may actually backfire. A long-term study of couples in Germany found that when partners expected something in return for favors or sacrifices, their satisfaction tended to decline over time. The study was published in the <em><a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/01461672251330700">Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin</a></em>.</p><p>Relationship researchers have long distinguished between two broad mindsets: communal and exchange orientations. A communal approach involves caring for a partner&rsquo;s needs without expecting direct repayment. By contrast, an exchange orientation involves a sense of keeping score. A person might expect their partner to repay a favor, match effort, or show appreciation in proportion to what was given.</p><p>Past research has repeatedly found that exchange orientation tends to predict lower relationship satisfaction. But most of that work was based on cross-sectional data, which can only capture snapshots at one point in time. That makes it hard to determine whether expecting reciprocity leads to dissatisfaction or whether dissatisfaction makes people more likely to keep score.</p><p>Little was known about how exchange orientation changes over time. Is it a fixed personality trait, or does it shift with the ups and downs of a relationship? Another open question was whether similarity between partners in exchange orientation might help or hurt. Some researchers speculated that if both partners shared the same transactional mindset, they might better understand each other&rsquo;s expectations. Others suspected that any form of scorekeeping, whether mutual or not, could disrupt the emotional connection that supports long-term intimacy.</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s been growing public concern that modern romance is becoming increasingly transactional&mdash;where people approach love less as emotional connection and more as a ledger of give-and-take. I thought exchange orientation, or the tendency to keep track of what one gives and receives, provided a timely and theoretically meaningful way to study this trend. It allowed us to ask whether adopting a transactional mindset actually shapes the course of romantic relationships,&rdquo; explained study author <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=ko&amp;user=r48auQUAAAAJ">Haeyoung Gideon Park</a>, a PhD candidate at the University of Toronto.</p><p>To investigate, the research team turned to a uniquely comprehensive dataset: a nationally representative panel of German couples followed for over a decade. This gave them the opportunity to track not only changes within individuals but also patterns across partners.</p><p>The researchers drew from the German Family Panel (pairfam), a long-running longitudinal study that follows individuals and their partners across different stages of life. For this project, they analyzed responses from 7,293 heterosexual couples who participated in up to seven survey waves over a 13-year period. The surveys were conducted every two years.</p><p>Participants responded to questions assessing their exchange orientation, such as whether they expected something in return when doing a favor or giving in to their partner. They also rated their overall satisfaction with their relationship using a standard scale. By collecting repeated responses from both members of each couple, the researchers could examine both individual and dyadic patterns.</p><p>To analyze the data, the researchers used a statistical approach called latent curve modeling with structured residuals. This method allowed them to separate long-term trends from shorter-term fluctuations and distinguish within-person effects (how someone changes over time) from between-person differences (how people compare to each other on average). They also used a technique called dyadic response surface analysis to explore whether partners&rsquo; similarity in exchange orientation had any impact on their shared satisfaction.</p><p>Across the full sample, the researchers observed that most individuals became less exchange-oriented as their relationships matured. In other words, over time, people were less likely to expect direct repayment or acknowledgment for sacrifices made in the relationship. This overall shift away from transactional thinking suggests that romantic partners may gradually adopt a more communal mindset as their bond deepens.</p><p>Importantly, the speed of this shift mattered. People who showed slower declines in exchange orientation were also more likely to experience steeper drops in relationship satisfaction over the years. This pattern held true even when controlling for initial satisfaction levels. It suggests that clinging to a transactional mindset may interfere with the natural development of emotional intimacy.</p><p>The researchers also examined more immediate changes within individuals. They found that when a person&rsquo;s exchange orientation increased from their usual level at a given time point, their relationship satisfaction tended to drop&mdash;both in that moment and two years later. These time-lagged effects support the idea that expecting something in return may gradually wear down relationship quality.</p><p>&ldquo;Our findings suggest that keeping score isn&rsquo;t just a reaction to relationship struggles&mdash;it can actually foreshadow them,&rdquo; Park told PsyPost. &ldquo;In other words, when people become more focused on payback, their satisfaction tends to decline in the years that follow. We also found that couples didn&rsquo;t necessarily benefit from both being transactional; what mattered most was whether either partner was focused on keeping things even. The less emphasis on payback, the better the relationship tended to be.&rdquo;</p><p>The researchers found little evidence that being dissatisfied led people to become more exchange-oriented later on. This points to a directional link in which transactional thinking tends to reduce satisfaction, not the reverse.</p><p>&ldquo;I expected that declines in satisfaction would predict increases in exchange orientation, but that wasn&rsquo;t the case,&rdquo; Park said. &ldquo;One limitation is that our data were collected every two years, which may have missed short-term or situational shifts.&rdquo;</p><p>Another key finding concerned partner similarity. While it might seem intuitive that sharing a similar mindset would promote harmony, the data did not support this assumption. Couples who were equally high or equally low in exchange orientation did not report greater satisfaction than couples who differed. Instead, relationship satisfaction was lower whenever either partner was more exchange-oriented, regardless of the other&rsquo;s views.</p><p>These results challenge the idea that &ldquo;matching&rdquo; mindsets protect relationships. Instead, they suggest that lower levels of exchange orientation in both partners&mdash;regardless of similarity&mdash;tend to support higher satisfaction.</p><p>&ldquo;I was surprised that partner similarity in exchange orientation didn&rsquo;t provide any benefits,&rdquo; Park said. &ldquo;As a follow-up, We&rsquo;re now examining the emotional processes that underlie the negative effects of exchange orientation, which may help explain why this mindset is harmful regardless of whether both partners share it.&rdquo;</p><p>It is important to note that the findings are correlational, which means they cannot establish definite causation. While the use of lagged analyses and longitudinal methods strengthens the argument for directional effects, it remains possible that unmeasured factors influenced both exchange orientation and relationship satisfaction.</p><p>Future research could explore whether the effects of exchange orientation differ across relationship stages. A transactional mindset might feel more acceptable in early dating relationships, but less so in long-term partnerships where emotional bonds are deeper. Another avenue is to examine how exchange orientation plays out across different domains.</p><p>&ldquo;Right now, we&rsquo;re investigating the emotional processes that contribute to the harmful effects of exchange orientation,&rdquo; Park explained. &ldquo;Looking further ahead, I&rsquo;d like to examine whether these dynamics differ across relationship stages (such as new vs. long-term relationships), across domains (such as chores, finances, or intimacy), and across cultures. It&rsquo;s also important to understand what leads people to adopt a transactional mindset in the first place, and whether it can be intentionally altered.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Our study highlights a simple but important message: love doesn&rsquo;t thrive on ledgers,&rdquo; the researcher added. &ldquo;Fairness matters, but constantly expecting something in return can quietly erode warmth and trust. Letting go of the mental tally may help relationships flourish.&rdquo;</p><p>The study, &ldquo;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/01461672251330700">&lsquo;Pay Me Back&rsquo;: Testing the Implications of Long-Term Changes and Partner Similarity in Exchange Orientation Within Intimate Relationships</a>,&rdquo; was authored by Haeyoung Gideon Park, Matthew D.

While younger perpetrators are often driven by chronic social rejection and status deprivation, older offenders are more likely to be reacting to acute life disruptions. By applying evolutionary theory, the authors propose that these acts of violence may reflect exaggerated responses to perceived threats to social status and control.</p><p>Mass murder is a rare but profoundly traumatic phenomenon. Although psychological and criminological research has documented many of the immediate precursors to these acts, the underlying question of why certain individuals respond to stress in violent ways remains open. The researchers behind this study aimed to address that question by integrating evolutionary perspectives, particularly Life History Theory and models of male competition, into existing frameworks.</p><p>This theoretical approach suggests that behaviors related to status, aggression, and reproductive strategy have been shaped by ancestral pressures and continue to influence modern behavior. While the authors emphasize that evolutionary theory does not justify or excuse violence, it may help explain why certain recurring patterns emerge in different types of offenders.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been studying mass violence for the past five years, driven by its devastating impact not just on direct victims, but on entire communities and social systems,&rdquo; explained study author <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/keith-minihane-a11a9b172/">Keith Minihane</a>, a PhD researcher in applied psychology, at University College Cork.</p><p>&ldquo;Despite the attention mass murder receives, there&rsquo;s still limited understanding of how offenders differ by life stage, and almost no work that systematically examines these differences through an evolutionary lens. This project emerged from that gap. We wanted to know: why do these crimes cluster in late adolescence and middle age, and what might that tell us about the underlying psychological processes at work?&rdquo;</p><p>To identify recurring psychological stressors among mass murderers, the researchers conducted a systematic review of peer-reviewed empirical studies. They searched four major academic databases, along with a manual search, identifying a total of 634 papers. After screening for relevance and applying strict inclusion criteria, 20 studies were included in the final synthesis. These studies all directly examined the motivations, stressors, and behavioral patterns of individuals who had committed mass murder, familicide, or school shootings, excluding ideologically motivated or politically driven cases.</p><p>One of the most striking findings was a bimodal age distribution among mass murderers. Offenders tended to cluster in either late adolescence or middle age, with each group displaying distinct behavioral patterns, motivations, and stress responses.</p><p>Younger offenders, including school shooters and public mass murderers, were often characterized by a history of social rejection. This included experiences of bullying, exclusion, and romantic failure. In many cases, violence was preceded by a long buildup of grievance, during which the offender internalized a sense of humiliation or insignificance. These individuals often left behind manifestos, videos, or social media posts expressing a desire for revenge or recognition. Some appeared to view mass violence as a way to assert dominance or gain notoriety, particularly after being denied social status during a key developmental period.</p><p>In contrast, older offenders were more likely to commit acts of familicide, often killing their partners and children before taking their own lives. These acts were frequently preceded by acute life crises, such as financial collapse, divorce, or job loss. In many cases, the offenders framed their violence as a protective or &ldquo;compassionate&rdquo; act&mdash;attempting to &ldquo;rescue&rdquo; their families from a perceived future of hardship. While the reasoning may appear twisted, the researchers suggest that these actions may reflect a distortion of evolved caregiving mechanisms under extreme stress.</p><p>What was particularly surprising was the consistency of these findings, Minihane said. &ldquo;Younger offenders were often driven by chronic rejection, humiliation, or identity struggles, while older offenders were more likely facing acute crises like divorce, job loss, or financial collapse. These themes emerged repeatedly. Different life stages, different stressors, but both converged on violence as a perceived solution to social failure.&rdquo;</p><p>Across both age groups, revenge was a consistently reported motivation. Whether directed at peers, romantic partners, employers, or family members, many mass murderers appeared to view their actions as a form of retaliation. This was especially true among younger offenders, who often blamed classmates or society for their perceived failures. The researchers point to evolutionary models of status competition and risk-taking to explain why some young men may be especially prone to respond violently to rejection or humiliation.</p><p>While younger offenders often survived their attacks, older perpetrators were significantly more likely to die by suicide. Suicide rates were especially high among those who committed familicide. These older offenders appeared to view violence as a final response to what they saw as irreversible status loss or existential failure. Rather than seeking fame or recognition, they often acted in private and left behind notes expressing despair, guilt, or hopelessness.</p><p>The review also noted clear sex differences. Mass murder is overwhelmingly committed by men. Women who do commit mass killings often act in domestic settings and tend to target family members using less direct means, such as poisoning or arson. Female perpetrators were also more likely to report motives tied to perceived altruism rather than revenge or dominance. These differences suggest that gendered patterns in violence may reflect underlying psychological and social distinctions shaped by both evolutionary and cultural factors.</p><p>&ldquo;Mass murder is seldom a sudden or random act; it is well planned, sometimes for years,&rdquo; Minihane told PsyPost. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s rarely the result of a mental health crisis in the way people often assume. In fact, people with mental health difficulties are far more likely to be victims of violence than perpetrators. Stigmatizing them only distracts from the real social and psychological dynamics we need to address, these dynamics include social stress, rejection, and perceived status loss. These pressures tap into deep-rooted psychological systems evolved to monitor threats to social standing and identity. That&rsquo;s important, because it helps us move beyond reactive explanations and toward proactive ways of identifying and interrupting pathways to violence.&rdquo;</p><p>The review also highlights key limitations in the current research landscape. Definitions of mass murder vary across studies, with some setting the threshold at three victims and others at four. This inconsistency can affect who gets included in analyses and may obscure meaningful comparisons across subtypes.</p><p>The researchers also acknowledge that the focus on peer-reviewed, English-language studies introduces potential selection bias. While the review includes international cases, much of the available research is based in Western contexts. A broader global dataset would allow for more culturally nuanced comparisons. The authors call for the development of a standardized international mass murder database to enable such analysis.</p><p>The authors also emphasize that evolutionary theory is not a replacement for existing models of violence but a complementary tool to help understand consistent patterns.</p><p>&ldquo;Evolutionary psychology is only one lens,&rdquo; Minihane said. &ldquo;Other perspectives such as feminist theory (mass murder is overwhelmingly carried out by males), and sociological and criminological approaches, are vital. Our goal isn&rsquo;t to replace those theories, but to augment them with a broader framework that highlights how age and life-history pressures shape responses to stress. Methodological considerations include our strict inclusion criteria, and, although worldwide studies were included, the literature still mainly focuses on western based offenders.</p><p>&ldquo;This paper is part of a larger effort to build a comprehensive, interdisciplinary framework for exploring extreme violence. One path we&rsquo;re pursuing now focuses on &lsquo;legacy tokens,&rsquo; manifestos, suicide notes, or online posts that reveal how offenders want to be remembered. As we recently saw with the case of Robin Westman, the publication of legacy tokens remains a crucial dimension of mass violence today. Our initial research into this topic revealed significant differences between how those in late adolescence and their early 20s conceptualize their violence as compared with middle aged offenders. This research was <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11896-025-09739-5">published earlier this year</a> in the <em>Journal of Criminal and Police Psychology</em> and offers an initial step in outlining how offenders narrativize their violence.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The key point, and I really want to stress this, is that evolutionary psychology does not excuse violence, nor does it offer a singular, explanatory framework,&rdquo; Minihane added. &ldquo;Instead, it helps explain why certain patterns emerge when evolved minds encounter modern stressors. By better understanding the distinct trajectories of younger and older offenders, we can improve focused risk assessment, identify warning signs earlier, and ultimately work toward prevention.&rdquo;</p><p>The study, &ldquo;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s40806-025-00443-5">The Bimodal Age Distribution of Mass Murder: a Systematic Review Using Evolutionary and Life History Perspectives</a>,&rdquo; was authored by Keith Minihane, Maria Dempsey, and Robert King.</p></div></section>]]></description><pubDate>Sat, 13 Sep 2025 15:50:56 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.psypost.org/women-prone-to-self-objectification-tend-to-have-lower-empathy/</link><title>Women prone to self-objectification (view and evaluate themselves mainly in terms of how their bodies appear to others) tend to have lower empathy with diminished theory-of-mind abilities—the capacity to understand that other people have their own thoughts, perceptions, and goals.

These women were also more likely to experience self-dehumanization. In turn, self-dehumanization was associated with diminished theory-of-mind abilities&mdash;the capacity to understand that other people have their own thoughts, perceptions, and goals. The paper was published in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/03616843251340962"><em>Psychology of Women Quarterly</em></a>.</p><p>Self-objectification is a psychological process in which individuals, especially women, view and evaluate themselves mainly in terms of how their bodies appear to others, rather than their abilities or internal qualities. Women who adopt this perspective often monitor their physical appearance, a behavior known as &ldquo;self-surveillance.&rdquo;</p><p>This habit leads them to compare themselves with cultural beauty standards, which are often unrealistic or unattainable. As a result, self-objectification is linked to body shame, as people judge themselves harshly for failing to meet these ideals. It can also heighten anxiety about how one&rsquo;s body is perceived in social situations.</p><p>Over time, these pressures may contribute to disordered eating and depression. Sexual experiences can also be affected, as self-objectifying individuals often focus on how their body looks rather than on their sensations or satisfaction. Women high in self-objectification may feel pressure to conform to external evaluations, which can lower self-esteem and increase vulnerability to depression. The process is not only psychological but also social, reinforced by media, advertising, and interpersonal feedback.</p><p>Study author Gian Antonio Di Bernardo and his colleagues set out to examine whether self-objectification interferes with the ability to understand other people&rsquo;s emotions and mental states. They hypothesized that women prone to self-objectification would show lower empathy, weaker theory-of-mind abilities, and a greater tendency toward self-dehumanization&mdash;the process by which individuals come to see themselves as less than fully human, denying their own dignity, agency, or worth.</p><p>The researchers conducted three studies. The first examined whether self-objectification was linked to decreased empathy. Participants were 226 heterosexual Italian women with an average age of 28. They completed an online survey that measured self-objectification (using the 14-item Self-Objectification Beliefs and Behaviors Scale), self-dehumanization, and empathy (via the Interpersonal Reactivity Index).</p><p>The second study repeated this procedure with a new sample of 336 heterosexual Italian women, who were slightly older, with an average age of 34. The third study also surveyed Italian heterosexual women but added an assessment of theory-of-mind abilities (the Reading the Mind in the Eyes test).</p><p>Results from the first two studies indicated that women more prone to self-objectification tended to report lower levels of empathy, including both cognitive empathy (perspective taking) and affective empathy (empathic concern). They also showed higher levels of self-dehumanization. A statistical model suggested that self-objectification may lead to self-dehumanization, which in turn predicts lower empathy.</p><p>The third study confirmed these findings and also showed that women who scored higher in self-dehumanization tended to have somewhat weaker theory-of-mind abilities. Although theory-of-mind performance was not directly associated with self-objectification, the researchers suggested that both may be indirectly linked through self-dehumanization.</p><p>&ldquo;Taken together, our findings suggest that a dysfunctional body image may have detrimental effects not only internally (i.e., the denial of full humanity to oneself) but also externally (i.e., greater difficulty in understanding others&rsquo; emotional and mental states). These results underscore the urgent need to challenge self-objectification and promote a healthier, more authentic perception of self,&rdquo; the study authors concluded.</p><p>The study sheds light on the links between self-objectification and empathy. However, it should be noted that all three studies were conducted on Italian women, mostly young. Results on other cultural and demographic groups might not be identical.</p><p>The paper &ldquo;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/03616843251340962">No Hard Feelings: The Role of Self-Objectification and Self-Dehumanization in Understanding Emotions and Mental States in Cisgender Heterosexual Women</a>&rdquo; was authored by Gian Antonio Di Bernardo, Chiara Pecini, Bianca Tallone, Giuseppe Raguso, and Luca Andrighetto.</p></div></section>]]></description><pubDate>Sat, 13 Sep 2025 04:15:32 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.psypost.org/study-finds-video-gaming-during-covid-19-had-little-impact-on-mental-health/</link><title>People spent slightly more time playing video games during COVID-19 pandemic, but this was not meaningfully associated with changes in mental health.

The findings are based on data from over tens of thousands of participants and indicate that concerns about gaming being a widespread risk to psychological well-being during lockdowns may have been overstated. At the same time, the results do not support the idea that more gaming led to mental health benefits either.</p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic led to sweeping lifestyle changes, including restrictions on in-person social interactions. Video gaming was often promoted as a safe form of entertainment that could help people stay connected and cope with stress. But some experts expressed concern that the rise in gaming might fuel problematic use and mental health problems.</p><p>Reports emerged of individuals playing for excessively long hours, raising questions about whether increased screen time was contributing to anxiety, depression, or other forms of psychological distress. Prior research offered mixed findings, with some studies suggesting that gaming could provide stress relief and emotional support, while others raised flags about overuse and potential harm.</p><p>&ldquo;Before the COVID-19 pandemic, video gaming was often criticized. Most stakeholders highlighted potential harms, such as gaming addiction, aggression, and social isolation. As a researcher focused on the positive aspects of digital media, I was struck by how the discourse shifted during the pandemic,&rdquo; said study author <a href="http://lukaszkaczmarek.com">&#321;ukasz Kaczmarek</a>, a professor at Adam Mickiewicz University, where he heads the Social Psychology Center, the founder of the Psychophysiology Laboratory: Gaming &amp; Streaming.</p><p>&ldquo;Within weeks, video gaming was widely recommended as an at- home activity with possible benefits. The World Health Organization (WHO) promoted active video game use for exercise (#HealthyAtHome). The WHO&rsquo;s #PlayApartTogether initiative disseminated &lsquo;stay-at-home&rsquo; messages through popular games. Early findings published during the pandemic also suggested that gaming might support well-being. At the same time, other experts, including the WHO, expressed concern that increased playtime could do more harm than good. There were worrying reports of individuals escalating from 2 to 14 hours of daily play, thereby increasing the risk of gaming disorder.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Consequently, we saw a need for a broad synthesis of the findings documented in the scientific literature, so that we can evaluate the role of gaming during the COVID-19 pandemic. We focused on gaming time because it is a behavioral metric frequently addressed by parents, industry, and policymakers. Moreover, it is the most commonly reported measure across studies, enabling a more comprehensive and robust meta-analysis.&rdquo;</p><p>The researchers reviewed studies published between March 2020 and December 2021 that reported on both gaming time and mental health indicators. They searched multiple academic databases and contacted dozens of researchers for unpublished data, ultimately including 17 studies that compared gaming time before and during the pandemic and 22 studies that analyzed the relationship between gaming time and mental health. In total, their analysis covered data from 37,778 participants.</p><p>The team focused on both positive mental health indicators&mdash;such as happiness, relaxation, and positive affect&mdash;and negative indicators, including stress, anxiety, depression, and loneliness. They also conducted moderator analyses to determine whether factors like geographic region or type of mental health measure influenced the results.</p><p>The results indicated a modest but statistically significant increase in gaming time during the COVID-19 pandemic (with an average effect size of d = 0.26). This suggests that people played more, but not dramatically more. The prediction intervals were wide, meaning some studies found notable increases while others did not.</p><p>&ldquo;Average increases in gaming time were small,&rdquo; Kaczmarek told PsyPost. &ldquo;The scientific literature indicates a more modest change than some industry reports suggest. This could result from gaming platforms&rsquo; limited ability to distinguish accurately whether a game account is being used by the primary user or by their children. Thus, the narratives around video gaming time during the pandemic might have been overstated.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My intuition was that increases in gaming time would be substantial. However, this was not the case. One possibility is that there was greater competition for access to electronic devices when all family members were at home, some of whom were teleworking. Another is that individuals and families found more attractive ways of spending time together that competed successfully with gaming, such as cooking or gardening. There may be many alternative explanations.&rdquo;</p><p>When the researchers examined the link between gaming time and mental health, they found no significant association. The overall correlation was r = &minus;0.03, which is close to zero. In other words, people who played more games during the pandemic were not significantly more likely to experience better or worse mental health than those who played less.</p><p>Even when broken down into positive and negative mental health indicators, the differences remained negligible. The researchers also tested for several potential moderators, including participant age, region, type of mental health measure, and data collection timing. None of these significantly altered the core finding: gaming time had no meaningful association with well-being or distress.</p><p>&ldquo;There is no clear evidence that time spent gaming, by itself, either helped or harmed mental health during the pandemic,&rdquo; Kaczmarek explained. &ldquo;On average, gaming time was not associated with negative indicators (e.g., depression, anxiety) or positive indicators (e.g., positive affect, happiness). At both high and low levels of mental health, some individuals played a lot and others played very little. This suggests that gaming time alone is unlikely to be the primary factor associated with mental health. Other parameters may matter more. For example, several studies point not to time but timing &ndash; when people play, so that sleep patterns remain intact.&rdquo;</p><p>There were a few exceptions. For instance, people in Asia showed a slightly stronger negative association between gaming time and well-being, and gaming time was more weakly linked to measures of psychological distress than to measures of positive well-being. But even these effects were small and likely of limited practical significance.</p><p>The authors suggest that much of the concern around gaming during the pandemic may have been based on anecdotes or extreme cases rather than representative trends. Similarly, the belief that gaming broadly improved well-being may stem from subjective impressions rather than consistent data.</p><p>&ldquo;There were so many striking reports showing evidence of the positive impact of games on mental health during the pandemic that I was surprised to see no association in the aggregated data,&rdquo; Kaczmarek said. &ldquo;Perhaps mass media selectively showed positive evidence more often.&rdquo;</p><p>There are limitations to note. Most of the included studies relied on self-reported gaming time and mental health, which can be influenced by memory biases and social desirability. The analysis also focused on average changes, which may obscure meaningful shifts in specific subgroups. For example, people who were already struggling with mental health issues before the pandemic may have been more affected by changes in gaming behavior than others.</p><p>In addition, the researchers could not account for people who began gaming for the first time during the pandemic. Games like Animal Crossing: New Horizons and Among Us surged in popularity and attracted many new players. These individuals may have had different experiences than regular gamers, but the data did not separate them out.</p><p>Future research could explore not just how much people play, but why and how they play. Measuring motivation, context, and quality of gaming experiences may provide a fuller picture of gaming&rsquo;s role in mental health. The researchers also advocate for more longitudinal studies and for the inclusion of both positive and negative mental health measures in future work.</p><p>&ldquo;We hope this publication will be a call to action for many researchers studying video gaming and mental health,&rdquo; Kaczmarek said. &ldquo;We observed recurring gaps in research designs. There is a need for more comprehensive research programs on gaming and mental health during pandemics or lockdowns. For instance, gaming time and timing should be measured in relation to mental health.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Moreover, researchers concerned with negative mental health metrics could also control for positive metrics as part of a standardized approach, and vice versa. This is important because positive and negative metrics of mental health are not redundant. Both are informative and are influenced differently by life opportunities and challenges. Such programs should start as soon as possible and be maintained between crises so that baseline data are available when future events occur. Finally, as new empirical data become available, we hope to have even more material for further analyses that will revise the outcomes or increase confidence in them, and provide new insights.</p><p>&ldquo;I previously mentioned that many individuals overestimate the risks of video gaming,&rdquo; Kaczmarek added. &ldquo;Paradoxically, this increased alertness may be a desirable state even if the vast majority of the population, in fact, benefits from video gaming. Most likely, this motivates individuals to be more observant regarding the development of negative symptomatology and to adjust their gaming behavior so that it fosters their mental health. I hope our findings will encourage readers to be more observant of their gaming activity and mental health and to game more thoughtfully, rather than taking these issues lightly.&rdquo;</p><p>The study, &ldquo;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-025-05581-6">Video game play and well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic: a meta-analysis of global findings</a>,&rdquo; was authored by &#321;ukasz D.

The new findings have implications for public health as well as the enforcement of laws related to cannabis and driving.</p><p>Approximately three-quarters of Americans live in a state where cannabis is legally available, and about 15% of Americans currently use cannabis. As cannabis usage becomes more widespread, understanding its effects on daily activities like driving is crucial to maintaining public safety and appropriate legislation around cannabis use.</p><p>While acute cannabis intoxication can <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2788264">impair driving</a>, it can be challenging to enforce cannabis and driving laws because, unlike alcohol, there is no biological test (e.g., blood concentrations) that directly relates to cannabis intoxication. Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the psychoactive compound in cannabis, can be detected in blood for several days to weeks after use, and in urine for weeks or even months.</p></div><div><div><p>One unanswered question around cannabis and driving is whether frequent cannabis users, who may or may not still have THC detectable in their blood, experience reduced driving abilities when not actively high. To answer this question, researchers analyzed data from two studies. The first, a randomized clinical trial, assessed driving performance in a sample of 191 cannabis users, all of whom had abstained for at least 48 hours. The second study compared a subset of the most frequent users from the first study with a smaller comparison group of people who don&rsquo;t use cannabis. A driving simulator was used to assess driving performance and potential impairment.</p><p>The researchers found no indications of reduced driving ability in cannabis users who had abstained for at least two days. First-author Kyle Mastropietro, a graduate student in the San Diego State University/UC San Diego Joint Doctoral Program in Clinical Psychology, commented, &ldquo;We did not find any relationship between driving performance, and cannabis use history or time of abstinence, nor blood THC concentrations. Of note, the most intensive users from the group, who mostly used cannabis daily and smoked an average of four joints per day, did no worse during this period of abstinence than a healthy, non-using comparison group.&rdquo;</p><p>Thomas Marcotte, Ph.D., professor of psychiatry at UC San Diego School of Medicine and the study&rsquo;s senior author, added, &ldquo;The findings add to the growing body of evidence that relying on blood THC concentrations in regular cannabis users as possible indicators of impairment is not justified, given that THC may be detectable many days (or longer) after use.&rdquo; Marcotte, who is also the co-director of the CMCR, added that &ldquo;the findings reinforce the challenges in relating findings from cognitive testing in very frequent users who are abstinent to how they might function during real-world, overlearned behaviors like driving.&rdquo;</p></div><div><figure> <img alt="Instructor view driver in a simulator" width="705" height="470" src="https://today.ucsd.edu/news_uploads/C0A9867-800px-Marcotte.png"> <figcaption><p>Using an onsite driving simulator at the Center for Medicinal Cannabis research, researchers at UC San Diego School of Medicine have found that frequent cannabis users show no driving deficits after at least two days of abstinence.

By last October, 73 hospitalizations and three deaths&mdash;all possibly associated with such products&mdash;had been reported across 34 states. &ldquo;The mislabeling highlighted in this [study] causes harms,&rdquo; Bruce says. &ldquo;And as usage rates increase across the U.S., harms from retail products are also likely to increase.&rdquo;</p><h2><b>Are Any Commercial Psilocybin Products Legal?</b></h2><p>Psilocybin comes from several mushroom species, including some in the genus<i> Psilocybe</i>. When consumed, the body breaks down the compound into psilocin, an alkaloid that can cause startling visual hallucinations and psychological effects, often including intense introspection. The U.S. federal government classifies both psilocybin and psilocin as Schedule I drugs, meaning they&rsquo;re deemed to have a high potential for abuse and no currently accepted medical use.</p><p>But a handful of states have recently legalized the manufacture, sale, possession and use of psilocybin under certain conditions. Both medical and recreational use are legal in Colorado, and New Mexico passed a law this year that legalizes certain medical uses. In Oregon the regulations are stricter: the drug must be taken in the company of a licensed facilitator at a specific &ldquo;psilocybin service center.&rdquo; These centers receive psilocybin from licensed growers, whose products are tested by a licensed laboratory.</p><p>Oregon does not allow the sale or use of psilocybin products outside of these centers; it is otherwise a criminal offense to buy, sell or possess the drug in the state. But the legal channels are prohibitively expensive to many: the average trip costs <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15265161.2024.2433420">somewhere between $750 and $1,200</a>.</p><p>This dynamic may be leading more people to try purported psilocybin products that are untested and prohibited but nonetheless sold at some retail stores, says legal researcher Mason Marks, a law professor at Florida State University who focused on psychedelics. &ldquo;A lot of people are very curious about these substances. And if you&rsquo;re in a state, like Oregon, that does not decriminalize them, people might go to these shops and buy these products that are either blatantly illegal or kind of in this gray area.&rdquo;</p><h2><b>Undisclosed and Untested Ingredients</b></h2><p>For the new study, the researchers purchased 12 edible products (11 gummies and a chocolate) that were advertised as containing &ldquo;magic mushrooms&rdquo; and were sold at gas stations and convenience stores in Portland. These products are &ldquo;being marketed widely in local convenience stores and on the Internet,&rdquo; van Breemen says.</p><p>The edibles were first tested at a state-licensed facility that normally certifies the quality of the drug for Oregon&rsquo;s psilocybin service centers. None of the products contained any psilocybin at all. To determine what they actually <i>did</i> contain, van Breemen and his colleagues turned to more advanced mass spectrometry techniques.</p><p>Seven products contained undisclosed active ingredients such as caffeine, kava extract (a legal herbal supplement with antianxiety and hallucinogenic effects) and cannabis extract (including the plant&rsquo;s main psychoactive ingredient, tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC). Four of the gummies contained no active ingredients at all.</p><p>Two of the gummies did contain psilocin, which also occurs naturally in some mushrooms in small quantities&mdash;and which is easier to synthesize in a laboratory than psilocybin. If the psilocin in the edibles came from natural sources, the researchers would expect to also detect other, related compounds from mushrooms. Such compounds turned out to be absent, leading van Breemen and his colleagues to conclude that the psilocin was likely synthetic.</p><p>Of greatest concern to the researchers, though, was the identification of synthetic psychedelic, or &ldquo;syndelic,&rdquo; compounds in two of the gummies. These drugs, mipracetin and 4-hydroxy-diethyltryptamine, have a chemical structure that is similar to that of psilocybin and psilocin and are psychoactive. Their effects on the body have not been studied in humans. "We don&rsquo;t know what harm they might cause,&rdquo; van Breemen says.</p><p>Van Breemen was surprised by the extent of the mislabeling. &ldquo;Over the years, we&rsquo;ve tested many botanical dietary supplements,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Rarely do you find 12 products, none of which contain what they're supposed to contain. So the sample number is small, but the number of mislabeled or adulterated products was significant.&rdquo;</p><p>This is an &ldquo;important and timely study,&rdquo; Bruce says. &ldquo;Psychedelics show initial promise for intractable mental health disorders, but science is still teasing out who will benefit and who will be harmed from their psychedelics experience.&rdquo; The Trump administration has <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/rfk-jr-suggests-administration-support-for-psychedelic-therapy-for-depression-trauma">indicated an interest in deregulating psychedelics</a> for therapeutic purposes. In this context, Bruce adds, &ldquo;the concerns I raise may become more widespread.&rdquo;</p></div><section><h2>It&rsquo;s Time to Stand Up for Science</h2><p>If you enjoyed this article, I&rsquo;d like to ask for your support. <span>Scientific American</span> has served as an advocate for science and industry for 180 years, and right now may be the most critical moment in that two-century history.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve been a <span>Scientific American</span> subscriber since I was 12 years old, and it helped shape the way I look at the world. <span>SciAm </span>always educates and delights me, and inspires a sense of awe for our vast, beautiful universe.

When parents find out, their natural response is often to warn their child: Continue with the behavior and you&rsquo;ll incur stricter rules, less freedom, and the loss of privileges.</p><p>On the surface, this response seems a reasonable attempt to deter further misbehaving. But how do teens actually experience these warnings&mdash;and why do some comply while others become even more defiant?</p><p>A team of US and Israeli researchers&mdash;among them <a href="http://www.rochester.edu">University of Rochester</a> psychologist <a href="https://www.sas.rochester.edu/psy/people/faculty/smetana_judith/index.html">Judith Smetana</a>&mdash;set out to find answers. The resulting <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10964-025-02196-7">study</a>, published in the <em>Journal of Youth and Adolescence</em>, concludes that the way teenagers receive their parents&rsquo; warnings depends less on the message itself and more on whether they see their parents as genuinely living up their own purported values.</p><p>If parents model their values consistently in everyday life and appear satisfied and vital while acting on their values, their warnings are more likely to be perceived by their teenagers as caring guidance. If not, teens often experience the warnings as an attempt to control them, which can spark defiance. But the researchers also discovered that while authentic parental values reduced defiance, they did not, by themselves, lead teens to stop their risky behaviors. The warnings proved most effective when parents took the time to understand their teens&rsquo; perspectives.</p><p>&ldquo;Parents really have to &lsquo;walk the walk&rsquo; and act on their values if they want their teens to behave responsibly,&rdquo;&nbsp;says Smetana, an expert on adolescent-parent relationships.</p><h3>The science behind motivation</h3><p>The study, Smetana points out, builds directly on&nbsp;a famous Rochester construct&mdash;the highly influential, evidence-based framework for motivation, called <a href="https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/community-health/patient-care/self-determination-theory">self-determination theory (SDT)</a>, which was formulated in the 1970s and 1980s by Rochester psychologists <a href="https://www.sas.rochester.edu/psy/people/faculty/deci_edward/index.html">Edward Deci</a> and <a href="https://www.sas.rochester.edu/psy/people/faculty/ryan_richard/index.html">Richard Ryan</a>.</p><p>According to SDT, people have three basic, intrinsic psychological needs:</p><ul> <li><strong>Autonomy</strong>&mdash;the need to feel free from control so one can realize one&rsquo;s authentic preferences</li> <li><strong>Competence</strong>&mdash;the need to feel capable</li> <li><strong>Relatedness</strong>&mdash;the need to feel connected and respected by others</li> </ul><p>When parenting actively supports these needs, adolescents feel motivated and understood. But when parents&rsquo; behaviors hinder these needs&mdash;what Deci and Ryan call &ldquo;need thwarting&rdquo; (where a person&rsquo;s basic psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness are actively undermined)&mdash;teens may feel pressured, powerless, or disconnected, which can trigger resistance and rebellion.</p><p>&ldquo;The idea of &lsquo;need thwarting&rsquo; leading to defiance is drawn directly from self-determination theory, as is the very important notion of autonomy-supportive parenting, which is widely used in studies of parenting,&rdquo; says Smetana.</p><h3>Modeling values while parenting</h3><p>Smetana and her team focused specifically on one parental factor called &ldquo;inherent value demonstration&rdquo; that can influence how warnings are received. For example, a parent who stresses the importance of kindness, volunteers regularly, and treats others respectfully&mdash;and appears satisfied and energetic while doing so&mdash;would be seen as high in value demonstration. In contrast, parents whose actions don&rsquo;t match their words would be perceived as low in value demonstration.</p><p>The team surveyed 105 Israeli adolescents, average age 15, who had engaged in at least one problem behavior in the previous month. Each teen reported the most serious behavior their parents had discovered and then rated how their parents reacted&mdash;whether through warnings or by trying to understand their child&rsquo;s perspective. The teens also shared how these reactions made them feel: Did they experience the reactions as supportive or as controlling? Did they feel motivated to stop, or did they feel defiant? Finally, they rated how much their parents generally demonstrated their values in daily life.</p><p>The findings were clear: When parents were perceived as low&nbsp;in value demonstration, their teens were much more likely to experience their warnings as&nbsp;&ldquo;need thwarting.&rdquo; But when parents were perceived&nbsp;as high&nbsp;in value demonstration, their warnings were more likely to be seen as protective and the teens experienced the warnings as &ldquo;need supporting.&rdquo; Teenagers in these families were less defiant and felt more supported, even if the warnings included unpleasant consequences, such as the loss of privileges.</p><h3>Stopping teens&rsquo; risky behaviors</h3><p>The researchers discovered that while authentic parental values reduced defiance, they did not, by themselves, lead teens to stop their risky behaviors.</p><p>&ldquo;We were surprised to learn that even children who perceived their parents as demonstrating their values in their everyday behavior experienced their parents&rsquo; warnings as frustrating and insensitive to their basic psychological needs,&rdquo; says lead coauthor Avi Assor at Israel-based Ben-Gurion University of the Negev. &ldquo;We thought that because parents&rsquo; warnings referred to potentially harmful problem behaviors, children who appreciate their parents as good models of virtuous behavior may not experience these warnings as insensitive to their needs.&rdquo;</p><p>Instead, the team found that the only parenting reaction linked to actually stopping the problem behavior was&nbsp;&ldquo;perspective taking&rdquo;&mdash;when parents tried to understand their child&rsquo;s feelings and reasons. This empathic approach seemed to prompt reflection, making it more likely that teens reconsidered and stopped their risky actions.</p><p>In short: Putting yourself in your teenager&rsquo;s shoes may be your best bet in trying to keep your child safe.</p></div></section>]]></description><pubDate>Thu, 11 Sep 2025 17:36:02 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://newatlas.com/chronic-pain/perfectionists-chronic-pain/</link><title>Chronic pain worsened by harsh self-criticism, study finds.

These psychological traits may intensify suffering, but they also point to new avenues for relief.</p><p>An international research team led by Australia's Murdoch University, recruited hundreds of Canadian adults, half with chronic conditions such as <a href="https://newatlas.com/tag/back-pain/">back pain</a>, <a href="https://newatlas.com/tag/arthritis/">arthritis</a> or <a href="https://newatlas.com/tag/migraines/">migraines</a>, and half without. Participants completed detailed online questionnaires regarding personality and coping styles. The team focused on three traits: perfectionism, self-compassion and general self-efficacy. Perfectionism was then split into two categories &ndash; self-oriented&nbsp;&ndash; the internal drive to meet very high standards&nbsp;&ndash; and socially prescribed, or the belief that others expect it. Self-compassion was gauged by how kindly people treat themselves in difficult moments. Self-efficacy measured the extent to which participants believed they can achieve goals and handle challenges.</p><p>&ldquo;We undertook this study because although the association between stress and pain is recognized, little is known about links between chronic pain and stress arising from perfectionist expectations,&rdquo; said Dr Graeme Ditchburn from Murdoch University's School of Psychology. </p><p>The two-part study involved 531 participants aged 18 to 65 years with chronic pain that had endured for longer than three months and 515 individuals with no chronic pain. In the first study, 237 participants with chronic pain and 237 without pain completed an online survey. The researchers found that those with pain had significant higher levels of socially prescribed perfectionism and lower levels of self-compassion than those without pain. In the second study, 294 individuals with chronic pain, and 278 without, completed the online survey. Those with chronic pain reported significantly higher levels of perfectionism and lower levels of self-compassion and self-efficacy than the pain-free group. </p><p>What's more, both kinds of perfectionism &ndash; self-oriented and socially prescribed &ndash; were higher in those with low self-compassion scores. Statistical analyses found that self-oriented perfectionism and self-compassion was positively associated with self-efficacy, while socially prescribed perfectionism was negatively associated with self-efficacy.</p><p>&ldquo;Chronic pain sufferers may experience frustration with difficulties performing day-to-day activities and push themselves toward unrealistic or unachievable goals,&rdquo; Ditchburn said. &ldquo;Furthermore, they may also feel that others have expectations that are difficult to meet.</p><p>&ldquo;Self-compassion may reflect fear of judgment or self-criticism, perceiving the pain condition and the burden caused by this condition as their own fault," he added. "These also have negative implications for perceptions of self-efficacy or self-belief in one&rsquo;s capacity. In turn, these have both direct and indirect associations with stress, which has negative consequences for physical and mental health."</p><p>Ultimately, across both studies, there were clear differences between those with chronic pain and those without &ndash;&nbsp;especially when it came to perfectionism. People with chronic pain reported higher levels of socially prescribed perfectionism, the sense of being judged and pressured by others. And in one of the two studies, they also scored higher on self-oriented perfectionism, suggesting they have an inner voice that demands constant flawlessness and performance. The researchers suggest this perfectionistic mindset may exacerbate pain by fueling stress, frustration and a relentless drive to &ldquo;push through&rdquo; rather than pacing activity in a sustainable way.</p><p>In both studies, those with chronic pain scored significantly lower in regards to self-compassion than their pain-free peers. Instead of treating themselves with understanding, chronic-pain sufferers were more likely to be harsh self-critics. The researchers described self-compassion as a protective buffer &ndash; so, without it, pain may feel like more of a load, stripping away emotional resources that build resilience.</p><p>While the study captures a snapshot in time rather than a direct causal link, and is based on self-reported data, it does highlight the role psychology plays in living with chronic pain. The way people evaluate themselves &ndash; and imagine others evaluating them &ndash; shapes how they endure long-term pain conditions. </p><p>This is important because these traits &ndash; perfectionism and self-compassion &ndash; can be changed. The researchers suggest that therapy and targeted coaching, including interventions such as cognitive-behavioral therapy, could help people quiet their inner critics. Earlier studies have shown that <a href="https://newatlas.com/health-wellbeing/chronic-pain-brain-chemistry-emotion-regulation/">chronic pain</a> alters brain chemistry and affects emotional regulation.</p><p>&ldquo;Our findings suggest that interventions aimed at increasing self-compassion and addressing perfectionistic tendencies may be beneficial for individuals experiencing chronic pain," Ditchburn. </p><p>The team suggest their work opens the door to more nuanced assessment of the relationship between psychology and physical impairment, which could help people with specific conditions better manage their <a href="https://newatlas.com/health-wellbeing/mindfulness-meditation-placebo-effect-pain/">pain and their mental health</a>.</p><p>"As the types and number of pain conditions may impact the individual physically and psychologically to different degrees, future research should explore whether the type of condition and degree of impairment, as perceived by the individual and others, are associated with perfectionism, self-compassion and self-efficacy," the researchers noted in the study. "Further studies examining the extent to which age is associated with perfectionism, self-compassion, and self-efficacy for those with and without chronic pain may also be beneficial, particularly if coupled with analysis of any association it may have with inter-relationships between the scales. </p><p>"Furthermore, given pain is not experienced in a vacuum but rather involves caregivers, family members and others, research is needed to explore the potential impact of these systems on the expectations, perfectionism, self-compassion, and self-efficacy of those experiencing chronic pain conditions," they added.</p><p>As therapeutic intervention is limited, other recent studies looking into non-drug treatments that build <a href="https://newatlas.com/chronic-pain/drug-free-pain-relief-game/">mental resilience</a> as well as <a href="https://newatlas.com/chronic-pain/chronic-pain-diet-adiposity/">changes to diet</a> have shown promise in chronic pain management and improved quality of life.</p><p>The study was published in the journal <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/epdf/10.1080/08870446.2025.2552227?needAccess=true"><i>Psychology and Health</i></a>.</p><p>Source: <a href="https://www.murdoch.edu.au/news/articles/new-research-uncovers-link-between-perfectionism-and-pain">Murdoch University</a></p></div></section>]]></description><pubDate>Thu, 11 Sep 2025 14:33:31 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/sep/10/link-oil-giants-heatwaves-research-legal-liability</link><title>New research directly links the carbon emissions from major fossil fuel companies to numerous deadly heatwaves, marking a significant advance in legal efforts to hold these corporations accountable for climate change damages.

The research has been hailed as a &ldquo;leap forward&rdquo; in the legal battle to hold big oil accountable for the damages being caused by the climate crisis.</p><p>The research found that the emissions from any one of the 14 biggest companies were by themselves enough to cause more than 50 heatwaves that would otherwise have been virtually impossible. The study shows, in effect, that those emissions caused the heatwaves.</p><p>The carbon pollution from ExxonMobil&rsquo;s fossil fuels, for example, made 51 heatwaves at least 10,000 times more likely than in an unheated world, the researchers found, as did the emissions from Saudi Aramco.</p><p>Global heating is making heatwaves more frequent and more intense across the globe, contributing to at least <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/climate-change-heat-and-health">500,000 heat-related deaths</a> a year. The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jul/21/pacific-northwest-heatwave-dome-climate-change">searing heatwave</a> that struck the Pacific north-west of the US in 2021 was made almost 3C hotter, for example.</p><p>The new research found that the total emissions from the 180 &ldquo;carbon major&rdquo; companies included in the analysis were responsible for about half the increase in intensity, with emissions due to forest destruction making up most of the rest. It also found that the 213 heatwaves studied became 200 times more likely on average from 2010 to 2019 owing to the climate crisis.</p><p>&ldquo;Being able to trace back the contribution of these single [carbon major] emitters and quantify their contribution could be very useful for establishing potential liability,&rdquo; said Prof Sonia Seneviratne, at ETH Zurich university in Switzerland, a senior author of the report.</p><p>Dr Davide Faranda, a research director at the French National Centre for Scientific Research and not part of the study team, said: &ldquo;This study adds a crucial new step: it connects the dots between specific climate disasters and the companies whose emissions made them possible. This bridge could become a cornerstone for legal and policy action to hold polluters accountable.&rdquo;</p><figure><figcaption><span>The heatwave that hit the Pacific Northwest of the US in 2021 (Seattle, pictured) was made almost 3C hotter by global heating, the study found.</span> Photograph: Jason Redmond/Reuters</figcaption></figure><p>Cassidy DiPaola, a spokesperson for the Make Polluters Pay campaign, said: &ldquo;We can now point to specific heatwaves and say, &lsquo;Saudi <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/aramco">Aramco</a> did this. ExxonMobil did this.&rsquo; When their emissions alone are triggering heatwaves that wouldn&rsquo;t have happened otherwise, we&rsquo;re talking about real people who died, real crops that failed, and real communities that suffered, all because of decisions made in corporate boardrooms.&rdquo;</p><p>The world&rsquo;s highest court, the international court of justice, ruled in July that failing to prevent climate harm could <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jul/23/healthy-environment-is-a-human-right-top-un-court-rules">result in having to pay compensation</a>, while a German high court set a legal precedent in May that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/28/rwe-peruvian-farmer-court-germany">fossil fuel companies could be held liable</a> for their contribution. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the evidence the courts have been waiting for,&rdquo; said DiPaola. &ldquo;The bill is coming due, and it&rsquo;s time these polluters pay for the damage they&rsquo;ve done.&rdquo;</p><p>The research, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09450-9">published in the journal Nature</a>, used a type of analysis called attribution. This compares the hotter world today with the world before mass burning of fossil fuels to assess how emissions have driven up temperatures, using weather data and computer models.</p><p>The scientists first worked out how much each carbon major&rsquo;s emissions had pushed up temperatures and then how much these higher temperatures increased the likelihood of heatwaves.

The work suggests that humans respond automatically to specific features in cries that ramp up when babies are in pain.</p><p>&ldquo;The emotional response to cries depends on their &lsquo;acoustic roughness&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Prof Nicolas Mathevon at the University of Saint-Etienne in France. &ldquo;We are emotionally sensitive to the acoustic parameters that encode the level of pain in a baby&rsquo;s cry.&rdquo;</p><p>Evolution equipped baby humans with a hard-to-ignore wail to boost their odds of getting the care they need. But not all infant cries are the same. When a baby is in real distress, they forcefully contract their rib cage, producing higher pressure air that causes chaotic vibrations in the vocal cords. This produces &ldquo;acoustic roughness&rdquo;, or more technically, disharmonious sounds called nonlinear phenomena (NLP).</p><p>To see how men and women responded to infants&rsquo; cries, scientists played recordings to volunteers with little or no experience with babies. While listening, the participants were filmed with a thermal camera that captured subtle changes in their facial temperature.</p><p>The adults listened to 16 different cries over four sessions and rated whether the baby was in discomfort or significant pain. The cries were recorded from babies in different levels of distress, ranging from discomfort in the bath to feeling the scratch of a needle at a vaccine clinic.</p><p>Footage from the thermal camera showed that men and women responded to babies&rsquo; cries in much the same way. The wails with the most NLP, regardless of pitch, were rated as coming from babies in real pain and triggered the greatest changes in the adults&rsquo; facial temperature.</p><p>Writing in <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsif.2025.0150">Journal of The Royal Society Interface</a>, the scientists describe how NLP in babies&rsquo; cries produces an automatic response in men and women, suggesting people pick up on the acoustic features to distinguish between babies that are merely unhappy and those in real pain.</p><p>&ldquo;The more pain the cries express, the stronger the response of our autonomic nervous system, indicating that we emotionally sense the pain information encoded in the cries,&rdquo; said Mathevon. &ldquo;No one had ever measured our response to cries like this before and it is too early to know if there will be practical applications one day.&rdquo;</p><p>The study follows <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39819066/">work last month</a> from researchers in Denmark that challenges the claim that women are hardwired to wake up more easily than men when a baby starts crying. It found that men were as likely as women to be woken by wailing infants, despite mothers being three times more likely to get up and tend to the child.</p><p>The reasons for the disparity are up for debate, but Prof Christine Parsons, who led the team, suggested two potential factors. First, mothers often took maternity leave before fathers took paternity leave and learned how to calm their baby earlier. Second, when mothers were breastfeeding, it might be sensible for fathers to sleep through.</p><p>&ldquo;Much of the previous work on adults&rsquo; physiological responses to infant crying has looked at heart rate, skin conductance, or even brain responses. So this study is innovating,&rdquo; Parsons said. &ldquo;People often assume there will be a clear distinction between men and women in how they respond to crying. The authors set out to test this, and found no evidence for a difference,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;We were also surprised at how little difference there was between men and women.&rdquo;</p></div></section>]]></description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Sep 2025 16:02:15 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://english.cas.cn/newsroom/research_news/life/202506/t20250620_1045926.shtml</link><title>Scientists Use Engineered Cells to Reverse Aging in Primates (english.cas.cn)</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/1nd27ng/scientists_use_engineered_cells_to_reverse_aging/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/1nd27ng/scientists_use_engineered_cells_to_reverse_aging/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p>Reading time: 3 min | <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/1nd27ng/scientists_use_engineered_cells_to_reverse_aging/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='preview-image'><img src='http://english.cas.cn/images/share_logo.png' /></section><section class='parsed-content'><div><p>As we age, our bodies gradually lose their ability to repair and regenerate. Stem cells diminish, making it increasingly difficult for tissues to heal and maintain balance. This reduction in stem cells is a hallmark of aging and a key driver of age-related diseases. Scientists have long debated whether this decline is the root cause of aging or a side effect. Efforts to use stem cell transplants to reverse aging have faced many challenges, such as ensuring the cells survive and integrate into the body without causing serious side effects, like tumors.</p><p>In a recent study published in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2025.05.021"><em>Cell</em></a>, researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Capital Medical University introduced a new type of human stem cell called senescence-resistant mesenchymal progenitor cells (SRCs)&nbsp;by reprogramming&nbsp;the genetic pathways associated with longevity. These cells, which resist aging and stress without developing tumors, were tested on elderly crab-eating macaques, which share physiological similarities with humans in their 60s and 70s.</p><p>The research team conducted a 44-week experiment on&nbsp;these&nbsp;macaques. The macaques received biweekly intravenous injections of SRCs, with a dosage of 2&times;10<sup>6</sup>cells per kilogram of body weight. The researchers found&nbsp;no adverse effects among the macaques. Detailed assessments confirmed that the transplanted cells did not cause tissue damage or tumors.</p><p>The researchers discovered that SRCs&nbsp;triggered a multi-system rejuvenation, reversing key markers of aging across 10 major physiological systems and 61 different tissue types. The treated macaques exhibited improved cognitive function, and tissue analyses indicated a reduction in age-related degenerative conditions such as brain atrophy, osteoporosis, fibrosis, and lipid buildup.</p><p>At the cellular level, SRCs decreased the number of senescent cells, reduced inflammation, and increased progenitor cell populations in neural and reproductive tissues. They even stimulated sperm production. At the molecular level, SRCs enhanced genomic stability, improved responses to oxidative stress, and restored protein balance. More than 50% of the examined tissues showed a reversal of aging-related gene expression profiles to a younger state. Single-cell analyses revealed significant reversals in gene expression among peripheral blood cells (33%), the hippocampus (42%), and ovarian tissue (45%). Machine learning-based aging clocks estimated that the biological age of immature neurons was reversed by six-seven&nbsp;years, and that of oocytes by five&nbsp;years.</p><p>Furthermore, the researchers found that tiny particles called exosomes, released by the SRCs, were the key agents of rejuvenation. These exosomes suppressed chronic inflammation while preserving genomic and epigenomic integrity. When isolated SRC exosomes were administered to aged mice, they significantly reduced organ degeneration. In vitro studies demonstrated that these exosomes could rejuvenate various human cell types, including neurons, ovarian, and liver cells. This discovery suggests that exosome signaling could be a fundamental pathway for reversing aging.</p><p>These findings highlight SRC therapy as a promising intervention for multi-system aging. It&nbsp;demonstrates protective efficacy across interconnected systems like the nervous, reproductive, and immune systems, presenting a holistic approach that surpasses single-target therapies.</p><p><span>SRC Reverses Lipid Buildup in Aged Monkeys' Skeletal Muscle: Control Group (Left); SRC-Treated Group (Right).
