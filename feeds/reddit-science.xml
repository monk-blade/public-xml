Yet dental care in the United States is still excluded from medical health insurance coverage and usually not integrated with public health initiatives that promote preventative care. A new study from a researcher at </span><a href="https://dental.tufts.edu/"><span>Tufts University School of Dental Medicine</span></a><span> found that nearly one in three young adults skipped visits to the dentist in the past year&mdash;and pointed to wider health and access problems that could affect the nation&rsquo;s future workforce and health systems.</span></p><p><span>Published recently in </span><em><span>Frontiers in Oral Health</span></em><span>, the </span><a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/froh.2025.1619983"><span>study</span></a><span> is the first to compare people&rsquo;s social and economic circumstances, access to dental care, and self-reported health challenges across different ages. The study builds on past research about cost and access barriers to dental care, but it provides new insights by showing that young adults are especially likely to miss out on care&mdash;and that factors like mental health and housing problems also play a role.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>&ldquo;Young adults, aged 18 to 35 years old, were the most likely to report not having visited a dentist within the past 12 months,&rdquo; says </span><a href="https://dental.tufts.edu/people/faculty/yau-hua-yu"><span>Yau-Hua Yu, D20</span></a><span>, the study&rsquo;s author and an associate professor of periodontology at the School of Dental Medicine. &ldquo;This is very troubling.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Her </span><a href="https://now.tufts.edu/2024/03/04/study-shows-correlation-between-self-reported-oral-health-and-systemic-health-outcomes"><span>earlier research</span></a><span> suggested that poor oral health is linked to shortened life expectancy and other negative health outcomes.&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><p><span>For this study, Yu analyzed health, demographic, and dental-care data from nearly 128,000 adults in the </span><span>National Institutes of Health</span><span>&rsquo;s All of Us program, one of the world&rsquo;s largest biomedical databases. Yu used the data to examine how physical challenges and mental health issues reported by individuals from different socioeconomic backgrounds varied depending on three factors: whether they had visited a dentist in the past year, their income level, and their age.</span></p><figure><p>The study found that nearly one in three young adults skipped visits to the dentist in the past year.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p></figure><p><span>&ldquo;Across all ages, people generally managed to see a doctor,&rdquo; says Yu. &ldquo;But those who skipped dental care most often pointed to cost and lack of insurance coverage.&rdquo; She says this finding reinforces the need to address the persistent policy gap in dental coverage, especially for those not covered by employer-based insurance or public programs.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Young adults who missed dental visits were also more likely to skip medical care, struggle with copays, rely on emergency care, and report poor mental health or memory problems. Yu found that this group of study participants were more likely to be renters, uninsured, and racially diverse&mdash;and that unstable housing added financial and emotional strain.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The study&rsquo;s age-based analysis revealed other important generational contrasts. While adults aged 66 years or older were more likely to have insurance and own a home, they also reported more disabilities. Individuals who reported difficulty walking, bathing, running errands, or concentrating were more likely to skip dental care, particularly among these older adults.&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><p><span>&ldquo;Our findings show the urgent need to integrate dental care into overall health care,&rdquo; Yu says. &ldquo;They also suggest that interventions must be tailored not only to income, but to life stage and cumulative disadvantage. The desperate need to bring routine preventative dental care to younger adults&mdash;who will be our prime source for societal productivity&mdash;should not be ignored.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>This may include expanding public dental insurance and integrating oral health equity goals into public health surveillance and primary care frameworks, Yu says.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>For older adults, barriers like transportation and mobility point to the need for home-based or mobile dental programs.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>For young adults, Yu adds that community organizations and faith-based health systems could be key partners in expanding access, as they already offer models of integrated affordable dental care.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>&ldquo;When dental care is rooted in trusted community spaces, it feels more familiar and supportive,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;That lowers the barriers of fear, inconvenience, and cost uncertainty that may keep some young adults away&mdash;and it helps them shift from waiting until there&rsquo;s an emergency to hopefully seeking regular, preventive care.&rdquo;</span></p></div></div></section><section class='separator separator-before-comments'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='comments'><p>Top comments</p><ol><li><div class="md"><p>Doesn’t help that in the U.S., dental insurance is basically a coupon.

Across three experiments involving hundreds of adults in the United Kingdom, women consistently expressed more fear, perceived higher risk, and were less inclined to explore wooded environments when potential dangers were present.</p><p>The study was partially inspired by a viral social media trend that captured public attention in 2024. The &ldquo;Man or bear&rdquo; debate asked users whether they would rather encounter a man or a bear while alone in the woods. Many women chose the bear, suggesting that they perceived a greater threat from an unknown man than from a wild animal. This phenomenon sparked a broader discussion about women&rsquo;s experiences of safety in natural environments and highlighted how social fears can shape engagement with nature.</p><p>Although earlier studies have shown that environmental features like vegetation density can influence feelings of safety, relatively few had examined how those effects may vary by gender, especially when different types of threats &mdash; such as social, animal, or physical dangers &mdash; are involved. The researchers sought to fill this gap using experimental methods that allowed them to systematically vary environmental cues and measure psychological responses.</p><p>&ldquo;I became interested in women&rsquo;s experiences in forests and greenspaces because I had a few experiences in nature myself when I didn&rsquo;t feel entirely safe, and as a consequence the visit was not as enjoyable as I hoped,&rdquo; explained study author <a href="https://abornioli.wixsite.com/annabornioli">Anna Bornioli</a>, a Marie Sk&#322;odowska-Curie Postdoctoral Fellow at the Barcelona Institute for Global Health and an associate researcher at the Environmental Psychology Research Group at the University of Surrey, where this study was conducted.</p><p>&ldquo;When chatting with my friends about this, I realised that many female friends empathized, having had similarly bad experiences. On the other hand, many male friends had no idea of what we were talking about. So I started to wonder if gender has anything to do with how we experience nature, and reflected on how gender stereotypes, the way we are brought up, and safety concerns can affect nature experiences. This specific study focuses on safety perceptions.&rdquo;</p><p>The research involved three separate studies, each using online simulations to present participants with images or videos of natural settings. These settings varied in the density of vegetation and the presence of different types of danger signals. In all three studies, participants were asked to imagine walking through the environment and to report their levels of fear, perceived risk, perceived danger (such as social or physical threats), aesthetic appraisal of the setting, and intention to engage with it.</p><p>In the first study, 269 university students viewed slideshows depicting nature settings categorized as open, medium, or dense. Participants imagined taking a walk through these environments after a stressful day and then completed a series of rating scales. The researchers found that women reported significantly more fear and perceived risk than men. They were also more likely to anticipate social dangers, such as being followed or assaulted. Men, by contrast, did not report significantly different levels of fear across the different settings.</p><p>&ldquo;I was surprised that men&rsquo;s experiences were largely unaffected by danger threats,&rdquo; Bornioli told PsyPost. &ldquo;The possible presence of wild animals or of a dangerous attacker did not trigger fear among men, compared to the control scenario that had no dangers at all. This could mean that men are less affected by possible threats, or that they are reluctant to express fear and concerns.&rdquo;</p><p>In terms of how vegetation density affected perceptions, both men and women viewed dense environments as more dangerous and less aesthetically appealing than open settings. However, the effect of density on fear and behavioral intentions &mdash; such as wanting to explore or leave the area quickly &mdash; tended to be stronger for women.</p><p>The second study replicated the first with a larger and more balanced sample of 414 adults, including both students and participants recruited online. This replication largely confirmed the previous findings. Again, women expressed more fear, rated the risk of encountering danger as higher, and were especially concerned about social threats. The effect of vegetation density was once more more pronounced for women, with denser settings amplifying their perceptions of risk and decreasing their willingness to engage with the environment.</p><p>The third study added a new layer by directly manipulating the type of danger sign participants saw before watching a video of a nature setting. These signs warned of different dangers: social threats (such as an assault warning), physical threats (like tripping hazards), animal threats (such as wild boars), getting lost, or no danger at all. This allowed the researchers to examine how specific threat types influenced fear and behavioral responses.</p><p>Across the board, women again reported higher levels of fear and lower willingness to explore the environments. This was especially true when the danger was social in nature. In fact, the presence of a social threat produced the strongest gender differences. Women&rsquo;s fear scores spiked significantly in these conditions, while men&rsquo;s responses remained largely unaffected. This pattern was not seen when the danger was physical or animal-related.</p><p>&ldquo;There are three important takeaways,&rdquo; Bornioli explained. &ldquo;1). Women consistently reported higher levels of fear and felt more at risk in natural environments than men. This was always the case, independently from the type of greenspace and from the presence or absence of danger threats. 2). &lrm;Gender differences were particularly pronounced in dense, heavily vegetated areas. There, women felt especially scared and unsafe. 3). Social threats were a key concern for women. When shown scenarios involving social dangers (a potential assaulter spotted in the same greenspace), women&rsquo;s feelings of fear increased significantly. This concern was much more impactful than other dangers, including wild animal threats (which is somehow in line with the social media trend &ldquo;man or bear&rdquo;).</p><p>&ldquo;All of this is problematic because spending time in natural spaces can offer important benefits for health and wellbeing, such as conducting exercise or restoring from stress. But a poor sense of safety can discourage people to visit greenspaces. If women don&rsquo;t feel safe in nature, this can perpetuate a form of gender inequality in nature access and enjoyment.&rdquo;</p><p>As with all research, there are some limitations. The experimental stimuli were videos and slideshows rather than real-world nature experiences. While these formats allowed for better experimental control, they could not fully replicate the sensory experience of being outdoors.</p><p>&ldquo;The studies are based on virtual experiments rather than on actual nature visits,&rdquo; Bornioli noted. &ldquo;Participants watched videos filmed in nature and were asked to image being there. In addition, when showing the videos we did not give instructions to participants on whether they were alone or in company. This is a factor that is likely to affect perceptions of safety.&rdquo;</p><p>Despite these limitations, the study offers consistent evidence across multiple experiments that women tend to perceive nature settings as more dangerous than men do, particularly when social dangers are implied. These findings have important implications for environmental design, public safety messaging, and efforts to promote equitable access to nature. Parks and natural reserves may benefit from interventions aimed at improving perceived safety, such as clear signage, regular maintenance to reduce dense overgrowth, or community programming that fosters a stronger sense of collective presence and care.</p><p>&ldquo;I am interested in understanding the reason behind these gender differences, and what can be done to improve perception of safety among women,&rdquo; Bornioli said. &ldquo;Are these concerns entirely due to the fact that women are more likely to be sexually harassed in public spaces? Or are they also related to cultural ideas on nature, and how girls and boys are brought up (other studies indicate that boys are generally encouraged to &ldquo;be brave&rdquo; and explore the outdoor, while girls get discouraged to be independent and are often warned about the dangers of nature)?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There could be several elements playing a role &ndash; for example, dense vegetation did contribute to fear perceptions among women. However, it is clear that in order to improve women&rsquo;s (and everyone else&rsquo;s) sense of safety in nature, the solution is not cutting down trees. The key is to address crime in natural and public spaces &ndash; and gender-based violence.&rdquo;</p><p>The study, &ldquo;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvp.2025.102722">Gender differences in safety perceptions and experiences of natural environments: The role of vegetation density and danger threats</a>,&rdquo; was authored by Alice Bornioli and Birgitta Gatersleben.</p></div></section><section class='separator separator-before-comments'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='comments'><p>Top comments</p><ol><li><div class="md"><p>As a woman who loves being in nature, I don’t feel secure if there’re no people around and I would be an easy target for a potential attacker.</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/1nkcb9q/women_tend_to_feel_more_fearful_in_nature/nex701x/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><div class="md"><p>They buried the important bit in the article.</p><p>&#39;Across the board, women again reported higher levels of fear and lower willingness to explore the environments.

When sunlight is sparse during autumn and winter, countries like the UK <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5a749fece5274a44083b82d8/government_dietary_recommendations.pdf">recommend people take supplements</a>.</p><p>Two forms of these supplements are available: vitamin D3, or cholecalciferol &ndash; which normally comes from lanolin, a waxy substance on sheep&rsquo;s wool &ndash; and vitamin D2, or ergocalciferol, which mainly comes from mushrooms. It was thought that it didn&rsquo;t really matter which one you took.</p><p>But now, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Emily_Brown54">Emily Brown</a> at the University of Surrey, UK, and her colleagues have performed a meta-analysis of 11 previously published randomised-controlled trials on vitamin D supplements, with a total of 655 participants.</p><p>They found taking vitamin D2 supplements can lead to a drop in the body&rsquo;s concentration of vitamin D3. Why this happens, or if vitamin D3 supplements reduce vitamin D2 levels, isn&rsquo;t entirely clear.</p><p>Furthermore, in many of the studies, the vitamin D3 levels were lower in people taking vitamin D2 than they were in control groups not taking any vitamin D supplements. &ldquo;This is a previously unknown effect,&rdquo; says Brown.</p><p>A 2022 study suggests <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2022.790444/full">vitamin D2 and D3 have overlapping but different roles in supporting immune function</a>. Only vitamin D3 seems to stimulate the type-I interferon signalling system, for instance, which provides a first line of defence against bacteria and viruses.</p><p>Brown says the findings suggest vitamin D3 supplements may be more beneficial for most individuals than vitamin D2, but adds personal considerations need to be taken into account, such as wanting to avoid animal products.</p><p>They also don&rsquo;t mean people should just stop taking vitamin D2, she says. &ldquo;Your total vitamin D level will still be sufficient if you are taking vitamin D2 supplements, but you might find that it&rsquo;s less effective and you might lose out on those additional functions in terms of immune support.&rdquo;</p><p><a href="https://ehe.osu.edu/human-sciences/directory?id=ziouzenkova.1">Ouliana Ziouzenkova</a> at The Ohio State University points out studies have shown that among older people, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36287374/">the conversion of vitamin D3 to its active form called calcitriol can be less efficient</a>, so D2 supplementation may be particularly beneficial in this population.</p><p>&ldquo;In the absence of any evidence for negative effects, if someone who is vegan is deficient in vitamin D, opting for a D2 supplement over no supplement remains the likely prudent choice,&rdquo; says <a href="https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/people/bernadette-moore">Bernadette Moore</a> at the University of Liverpool in the UK.</p><p>Plant-based vitamin D3 has started to become more accessible.

A new study shows those daily snacks quietly add up to the equivalent of nearly two alcoholic beverages for humans.</p><p>A team of scientists at University of California Berkeley and other institutions tested the fruit chimps actually snack on: figs in Uganda's canopy and the plum-like fruits on the forest floor in C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire. Collecting the data wasn't easy &mdash; with little electricity beyond solar panels and constant humidity threatening the instruments, researchers spent three seasons hauling equipment and calibrating test kits to measure alcohol in many different tropical fruits.&nbsp;</p><p>In the end, they found that on average, the fruit's alcohol content came in at about .3% by weight. This is kombucha-level, but when chimpanzees eat 10 pounds of fruit a day and weigh around 90 pounds, it adds up to about 14 grams of ethanol, equating to about two cocktails for a human.&nbsp;</p><p>But don't picture chimps swinging drunkenly from the trees. To actually get drunk, they'd have to binge on fruit until their bellies ballooned, the researchers said.

Both groups tended to report elevated levels of emotional distress in social situations, but only individuals with autism showed lower levels of emotional concern for others. The researchers also introduced a new way to distinguish between these overlapping conditions: a ratio of self-focused distress to other-oriented concern. This metric, they argue, could help improve diagnosis and support strategies.</p><p>Autism and social anxiety are both linked to social difficulties, but for different reasons. People with autism spectrum condition often struggle with understanding and responding to social cues. Social anxiety, on the other hand, involves intense fear of being judged or rejected in social situations. These overlapping traits often make it difficult to distinguish between the two in clinical settings, especially since many autistic people also experience high levels of social anxiety. This overlap has created a need for better tools to tease apart the similarities and differences in how these groups perceive and respond to others.</p><p>One of the key traits involved in social functioning is empathy, which can be broadly divided into two components. Cognitive empathy involves understanding another person&rsquo;s thoughts and feelings. Affective empathy relates to emotional responses to others, such as compassion or distress. Prior studies suggest that people with autism tend to show lower cognitive empathy and mixed patterns in emotional empathy, with some reports of heightened emotional distress. In contrast, individuals with social anxiety may show high emotional reactivity but impaired accuracy in interpreting others&rsquo; mental states. Yet few studies have directly compared these two groups on both forms of empathy, using tools that can separate the different aspects.</p><p>To address this gap, researchers at the Bruckner Autism Research Center at Ariel University recruited 105 university students and divided them into three groups. One group consisted of students with a confirmed autism diagnosis. A second group included students with high levels of social anxiety but no autism diagnosis. The third group served as a control sample, reporting neither autism nor elevated anxiety.</p><p>All participants completed several standardized assessments, including the Interpersonal Reactivity Index, which measures both cognitive and affective empathy, and the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test, which evaluates the ability to infer emotions based on subtle facial cues.</p><p>The results suggested clear differences between the groups when it came to trait-based empathy. Individuals in the autism group scored lower on perspective taking and empathic concern compared to the control group. Their empathic concern scores were also lower than those in the social anxiety group. Both the autism and social anxiety groups reported significantly higher levels of personal distress in response to others&rsquo; emotions compared to the control group. This suggests that while both groups experience intense emotional reactions in social situations, only the autistic group showed a notable reduction in the ability to feel concern for others.</p><p>One of the study&rsquo;s key contributions was the introduction of a novel metric: the personal distress-to-empathic concern ratio. This ratio compares how much emotional discomfort a person feels in response to others&rsquo; distress (personal distress) to how much they feel for the person experiencing it (empathic concern). A higher ratio indicates a more self-focused, emotionally overwhelmed response.</p><p>The researchers found that the autism group had the highest average ratio, followed by the social anxiety group, and then the control group. This ratio was also positively linked to the severity of autistic traits and anxiety symptoms, but only in the autism group. In other words, higher emotional distress relative to empathic concern was particularly associated with autism.</p><p>Importantly, the researchers tested whether this ratio could help distinguish between autism and social anxiety. Using a statistical approach called receiver operating characteristic analysis, they identified a cutoff value of 0.83 on the ratio scale. This value demonstrated good sensitivity, meaning it could correctly identify many individuals with autism, though its specificity was moderate, indicating a moderate ability to rule out autism in those without it. This finding suggests that the PD/EC ratio, while not a standalone diagnostic tool, could serve as a useful screening measure in conjunction with other assessments.</p><p>When it came to the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test, which provides a snapshot of a person&rsquo;s ability to recognize emotions from subtle visual cues, the groups performed similarly. All scored within the normal range, and no significant differences emerged. This suggests that state-based cognitive empathy, at least as measured by this task, may not differ meaningfully across these populations.</p><p>However, the researchers noted that the simplicity of the task might not fully capture the complexity of real-life social interactions, particularly for autistic individuals who may rely on compensatory strategies in structured testing environments.</p><p>&ldquo;We observed a significant difference in empathy levels between the autism and social anxiety groups,&rdquo; explained study author Esther Ben-Itzchak, the head of the Bruckner Autism Research Center. &ldquo;Both groups experienced higher personal distress compared to the control group; however, only the participants with autism showed significantly lower levels of empathic concern. This difference was effectively illustrated by a new ratio we developed, called the personal distress-to-empathic concern ratio (PD/EC). This ratio successfully distinguished between autism and social anxiety, conditions that frequently overlap in clinical settings, which was both surprising and exciting.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We were also surprised that by using a well-known and widely applied measure, the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) in a new way, namely computing the ratio between personal distress and empathic concern, we could provide a fresh application for this classic tool.&rdquo;</p><p>The findings support a growing view that empathy is not a single, unified trait but a multidimensional construct, with different profiles emerging across psychological conditions. In the case of autism, the study suggests a combination of reduced perspective taking and empathic concern, coupled with heightened personal distress. For those with social anxiety, the pattern includes elevated distress without a corresponding drop in empathic concern. These distinctions have important implications for how we assess and support individuals facing social challenges.</p><p>The study also aligns with existing theories about emotional regulation in autism. One model suggests that autistic individuals may experience high levels of emotional arousal in social situations but lack the cognitive tools to manage those emotions effectively. This imbalance may lead to withdrawal or self-focused responses, which can be misinterpreted as a lack of empathy. The current findings add nuance to this picture by showing that lower levels of empathic concern are not necessarily universal but may interact with how individuals experience and regulate emotional distress.</p><p>Like all research, there are limitations. Most notably, the social anxiety group was identified using a self-report scale rather than clinical interviews, which means some participants may not meet formal diagnostic criteria. The sample also included a relatively small number of women, which limits generalizability across genders.</p><p>Another limitation involves the overlapping nature of autism and social anxiety. In this study, about three-quarters of the autistic group also scored high on the social anxiety measure. Although the authors ran additional analyses to control for this overlap, it remains difficult to completely disentangle the effects of each condition. A follow-up study with larger groups could compare autistic individuals with and without social anxiety, alongside a group with social anxiety but no autism, to better isolate the unique contributions of each condition to empathy profiles.</p><p>&ldquo;Incorporating experimental tasks or physiological measures of empathy in future work could enhance the validity and depth of the findings,&rdquo; Ben-Itzchak said.</p><p>Still, the current findings offer a compelling direction for future research and clinical practice. The PD/EC ratio provides a fresh application of a well-established empathy questionnaire and shows promise as a simple, scalable measure to support diagnostic differentiation. It may also help guide targeted interventions by highlighting specific empathy-related challenges, such as managing distress or building perspective-taking skills.</p><p>&ldquo;We see two main directions for extending this work,&rdquo; Ben-Itzchak explained. &ldquo;First, we plan to replicate the findings across different populations by including more women in similar young adult samples, as well as examining clinical populations and younger children.

In the case of autism, the study suggests a combination of reduced perspective taking and empathic concern, coupled with heightened personal distress. For those with social anxiety, the pattern includes elevated distress without a corresponding drop in empathic concern. These distinctions have important implications for how we assess and support individuals facing social challenges.</p><p>The study also aligns with existing theories about emotional regulation in autism. One model suggests that autistic individuals may experience high levels of emotional arousal in social situations but lack the cognitive tools to manage those emotions effectively. This imbalance may lead to withdrawal or self-focused responses, which can be misinterpreted as a lack of empathy. The current findings add nuance to this picture by showing that lower levels of empathic concern are not necessarily universal but may interact with how individuals experience and regulate emotional distress.</p></blockquote><p>(Because people were asking about how this ties to other literature on autism &amp; empathy in the previous version of this post).</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/1njbegx/empathy_may_operate_quite_differently_in/neozs9u/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><div class="md"><p>People use the word &quot;empathy&quot; for different concepts.

Sexless men tended to suffer more from nerves, unhappiness, loneliness, and were less likely to believe their life is meaningful.</em> </p><p><em>Throughout this discussion, the issue of causality is ever-present—the causal pathways underlying these cross-sectional associations are likely to be complex. In the case of the affective well-being indicators, one possibility is that never having had sex takes a toll on one’s happiness, given that sex is a fundamental human drive, deeply important in our evolutionary history.</em></p><p><em>Other results in our data point to indirect routes in the same direction — sexless individuals (especially men) were much more likely to live alone, have less frequent social visits, and lack a confiding relationship or anyone to confide in. There were corresponding genetic correlations with these social variables too.</em> </p><p><em>...  On the other hand, autistic spectrum disorder showed a substantial positive genetic correlation with sexlessness, consistent with the interpersonal difficulties characteristic of the spectrum; autistic individuals commonly report difficulties developing intimate relationships (</em><a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2418257122#core-collateral-r17"><em>17</em></a><em>).</em></p></blockquote><p>The authors are very careful not to oversell their findings.</p><blockquote><p><em>Box 1.

To minimize misinterpretations, we want to emphasize the complex nature of these associations. The genetic associations we identified should not be presented as identification of “genes for late-life sexlessness” for several reasons outlined below.</em></p><p><em>Associations between genetic variants and behavioral traits likely reflect a culture-specific interplay between underlying heritable factors and environmental influences (</em><a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2418257122#core-collateral-r14"><em>14</em></a><em>). An association observed in a contemporary Western society should not be generalized as a universally applicable genetic effect on sexlessness. Therefore, our genetic and phenotypic associations may not apply to populations of different ancestries or cultural backgrounds.</em></p><p><em>Moreover, the polygenic scores derived from these genetic associations are not suited to predict individual-level outcomes regarding sexlessness. These polygenic scores are based on approximations of small effects within a large sample from a specific population. Therefore, it is inevitable that there will be many individuals who score high on such a polygenic score yet low on its target trait, and vice versa.</em></p><p><em>Overall, it is important to note that genetics is only one facet of the complex network of factors influencing behavior. Environmental, social, cultural, and individual factors all play significant roles, and their interactions with genetics further complicate the picture. This study points to possible avenues for investigation and should be seen as an exploration of correlations, not a claim of cause-and-effect relationships.</em></p></blockquote></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/1nj3vol/sexlessness_is_associated_with_higher_iq/nenkrvd/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><div class="md"><p>This is specifically about people who are virgins at a late stage in life, not people who haven&#39;t had sex in a while.</p><p>This study is perhaps the most comprehensive one in a while since their sample size is over 400,000</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/1nj3vol/sexlessness_is_associated_with_higher_iq/neoi1nc/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><div class="md"><p>And lifelong sexlessness is also noted by the authors as  associated with loneliness and unhappiness.</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/1nj3vol/sexlessness_is_associated_with_higher_iq/nenknot/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p></li></ol></section>]]></description><pubDate>Wed, 17 Sep 2025 10:15:07 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/our-sun-is-becoming-more-active-and-nasa-doesnt-know-why</link><title>NASA scientists say our Sun's activity is on an escalating trajectory, outside the boundaries of the 11-year solar cycle.

Now, scientists say that the Sun's activity is on an escalating trajectory, outside the boundaries of the 11-year solar cycle. In fact, a new analysis of the data suggests that the activity of the Sun has been gradually rising since 2008.</p><p>"All signs were pointing to the Sun going into a prolonged phase of low activity," <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/science-research/heliophysics/nasa-analysis-shows-suns-activity-ramping-up/">says plasma physicist Jamie Jasinski</a> of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). "So it was a surprise to see that trend reversed. The Sun is slowly waking up."</p><p><b>Related: </b><a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/something-is-up-with-the-sun-and-it-could-mean-our-models-are-wrong"><b>The Sun Is Being Weird. It Could Be Because We're Looking at It All Wrong.</b></a></p><p>The Sun seems like a constant, reassuring presence day to day, but it's actually fairly tempestuous and changeable. One particular change it undergoes is what we call the solar cycle. Every 11 years or so, the Sun undergoes an increase in activity to <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/its-official-nasa-declares-the-solar-maximum-is-happening-now">solar maximum</a> before subsiding again down to solar minimum.</p><p>This activity manifests as a significant increase in sunspots, solar flares, and coronal mass ejections at solar maximum, at which point the Sun's poles reverse their polarity. It's all very normal; if the number didn't give it away, we're currently in the 25th solar cycle on record, which means scientists have been watching this happen for centuries now, using sunspots as a proxy to record solar activity.</p><p>However, even with this wealth of solar cycle data, predicting how the Sun is going to behave is an inexact art. There's a lot more going on inside the Sun than we are privy to, driving changes that scientists are still trying to explain.</p><p>For example, for <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/we-might-finally-be-able-to-find-out-why-the-sun-was-naked-for-70-years">a 70-year period from 1645 to 1715</a>, almost no sunspots appeared at all, a period known as the Maunder Minimum. A similar lull occurred between 1790 and 1830, known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalton_Minimum">Dalton Minimum</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/solar-cycle-graph.jpg" alt width="642" height="266" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/solar-cycle-graph.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/solar-cycle-graph-600x249.jpg 600w"><figcaption>A graph showing sunspot activity since 1750.

"The longer-term trends are a lot less predictable and are something we don't completely understand yet."</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_solar_cycles">Solar cycles</a> 22 and 23, commencing in 1986 and 1996, respectively, were pretty average in terms of sunspot activity. In spite of this, the solar wind pressure steadily decreased over both cycles, leading scientists to believe that we might be headed towards something similar to the Maunder or Dalton events.</p><p>In 2008, Solar Cycle 24 commenced, becoming one of the weakest solar cycles on record in terms of sunspot and flare activity. Solar Cycle 25, scientists thought, was going to be more of the same, but its activity level turned out to be higher, more consistent with an average solar cycle.</p><p>Jasinski and his colleague, space physicist Marco Velli of JPL, have now analyzed <a href="https://omniweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/">long-term solar data</a> and found something surprising. In 2008, at the start of Solar Cycle 24, the solar wind began growing stronger and has continued to increase steadily since then.</p><div></div><p>That strength is measured in speed, density, temperature, thermal pressure, mass, momentum, energy, and magnetic field magnitude, all of which showed an increase.</p><p>Now, the Sun is an extraordinarily complex engine, and one thing that's crystal clear is that it's really difficult to predict what it's going to do next. Jasinski and Velli believe their findings indicate that we could see an uptick in rowdy space weather, with powerful winds, <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/geomagnetic-storms">solar storms</a>, flares, and coronal mass ejections.</p><p>Their results are also consistent with another aspect of the Sun's behavior: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hale%27s_law">Hale cycle</a>. This is represented by pairs of solar cycles, with each Hale cycle lasting 22 years, ending when the magnetic poles swap back to their original polarities. A growing body of evidence suggests that the Hale cycle is the primary cycle, and each solar cycle is only half of the full cycle.</p><p>At the moment, the solar wind pressure is still lower than it was at the turn of the 20th century. The only way we will know what it does from this point is to continue observing to see whether it continues to increase or remains stable.</p><p>The findings also have much broader implications, adding to the mounting evidence that sunspot numbers present, at best, an incomplete picture. We need to study a much wider catalog of solar behavior if we wish to understand the dynamics of our wild, beautiful star.</p><p>The research has been published in <a href="https://doi.org/10.3847/2041-8213/adf3a6"><i>The Astrophysical Journal Letters</i></a>.</p></div><div class="gallery"><p><img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/SungFXUsoqw/0.jpg"></p><p><img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/TWjtYSRlOUI/0.jpg"></p></div></section><section class='separator separator-before-comments'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='comments'><p>Top comments</p><ol><li><div class="md"><p>It just means that the long term models aren’t good enough to make accurate predictions yet.

In the present trial, the researchers delivered mild electrical currents to a specific brain area, the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), a region often linked to mood regulation.</p><p>Sixty-eight adults aged 18 to 65 with moderate to severe &ndash; but not treatment-resistant &ndash; depression were enrolled in the randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled trial (that is, neither participants nor assessors knew who received real vs. fake treatment). Participants were either taking a stable regimen of antidepressants or not taking them at all. People with bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, or neurological disorders were excluded.</p><p>Participants were randomized to receive either active HD-tDCS therapy (at a current of 2 mA) or sham therapy for 20 minutes every day for 12 consecutive working days. This setup was personalized for each participant, using MRI scans and <a href="https://www.modalis.com.au/tms-therapies/what-is-tms/what-is-neural-navigation/#:~:text=What%20is%20Neuronavigation?%20%2D%20Modalis,structure%20and%20external%20navigation%20points.">neuronavigation</a> to precisely target the DLPFC. The active group received a current of 2 mA with brief (30-second) periods of ramping, whereas the sham group got a ramp-up/ramp-down current that felt real but wasn&rsquo;t therapeutically active.

The average improvement in the active group was &ndash;7.8 points on HAM-D, and in the sham group, &ndash;5.6 points. This difference was statistically significant. Regarding remission rates, 39.5% of active participants went into remission (defined as a HAM-D score of &le; 7), compared to only 13.3% in the sham group.</p><p>Some benefits were seen halfway through treatment (day six), suggesting faster improvement than standard antidepressants or psychotherapy, which usually take weeks to produce an effect. Anxiety scores also improved more in the active group, hinting that HD-tDCS could help both depression and anxiety. The treatment was generally well-tolerated. Mild side effects included skin redness, itching, or burning sensations at the electrode site, but these were minimal. No serious adverse effects were reported.</p><p>&ldquo;Overall, the HD-tDCS therapy was effective and well-tolerated, with only mild to no side-effects observed in the study,&rdquo; said Katherine Narr, a professor in UCLA&rsquo;s Department of Neurology and the study&rsquo;s senior author. "Coupled with tDCS&rsquo;s potential for convenient at-home use, this approach may offer a new treatment option for those seeking alternatives to medication or talk therapy.&rdquo;</p><p>The sample size was smaller than planned, partly due to COVID-19-related recruitment issues. Further, the trial wasn&rsquo;t designed to examine how HD-tDCS interacted with antidepressants, so any combined effects remain unclear. While the sham group only received a very tiny current, it may not have been completely inert. Participants were only tracked for four weeks after treatment, so the long-term effectiveness of the treatment isn&rsquo;t known. It&rsquo;s unknown whether the effects fade without the administration of &ldquo;booster&rdquo; sessions. And, while treatment was individualized, the researchers didn&rsquo;t directly compare personalized vs. non-personalized HD-tDCS.</p><p>Despite these limitations, HD-tDCS could become a fast-acting, non-drug option for people with moderate to severe depression, especially those who can&rsquo;t tolerate medication side effects.

People who expressed the most intense agreement with these prejudiced views were also more likely to say they supported or would personally engage in violence to achieve political objectives. When these forms of bias were combined into a broader measure of generalized hostility, the association with violent attitudes became even more pronounced.</p><p>The research was conducted by a team at the University of California, Davis, as part of a larger project to track support for political violence in the U.S. over time. The researchers aimed to quantify how various types of bias contribute to a person&rsquo;s willingness to justify or commit acts of political violence. They used the term &ldquo;allophobia&rdquo; to describe a generalized fear or hatred of others&mdash;an umbrella category that includes racism, antisemitism, xenophobia, Islamophobia, transphobia, hostile sexism, and homonegativity.</p><p>Concerns about the potential for widespread political violence in the United States have increased in recent years, particularly following the January 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol, the attempted assassination of Donald Trump, the assassination of Democratic Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman, and the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. While past research has suggested that individual forms of prejudice are linked to violent behavior, the new study is one of the first to quantify how these views relate to political violence specifically, and on a nationally representative scale.</p><p>The study&rsquo;s findings are drawn from the second wave of an annual, nationally representative longitudinal survey, conducted between May 18 and June 8, 2023. A total of 9,385 adults completed the questionnaire, reflecting an 84 percent completion rate. The survey sample was weighted to mirror national demographics, with respondents averaging nearly 49 years of age. Just over half were women, and more than 60 percent identified as white and non-Hispanic.</p><p>Participants were asked to respond to a series of statements aimed at measuring prejudice toward various groups, including immigrants, Muslims, Jewish people, women, sexual minorities, gender-diverse individuals, and racial minorities. These questions were adapted from validated psychological scales but presented in shortened formats.</p><p>For example, to assess homonegativity, respondents rated their agreement with statements such as &ldquo;Gay men and lesbian women should stop shoving their lifestyle down other people&rsquo;s throats&rdquo; and &ldquo;Celebrations such as Gay Pride Day are ridiculous.&rdquo; Racism was assessed with items like &ldquo;Discrimination against whites is as big a problem as discrimination against Blacks and other minorities.&rdquo;</p><p>Transphobia was evaluated through items including &ldquo;I think there is something wrong with a person who says they are neither a man nor a woman,&rdquo; and &ldquo;I avoid people on the street whose gender is unclear to me.&rdquo; Xenophobia was measured with statements such as &ldquo;Interacting with immigrants makes me uneasy&rdquo; and &ldquo;I am afraid that our own culture will be lost with an increase in immigration.&rdquo;</p><p>Islamophobia was probed with items like &ldquo;Most Muslims living in the United States are more prone to violence than other people,&rdquo; while antisemitism included agreement with the idea that &ldquo;Jewish people have too much power in the media&rdquo; or &ldquo;talk about the Holocaust just to further their political agenda.&rdquo; Hostile sexism was assessed using statements such as &ldquo;Women seek to gain power by getting control over men&rdquo; and &ldquo;When women lose to men in a fair competition, they typically complain about being discriminated against.&rdquo;</p><p>In addition to these measures, the survey included multiple questions about political violence. Respondents were asked how much they agreed with general statements such as, &ldquo;True American patriots may have to resort to violence in order to save our country,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The United States needs a civil war to set things right.&rdquo; They were also asked whether they thought violence was justified in specific scenarios, such as stopping an election from being stolen, preventing illegal immigration, or protecting an &ldquo;American way of life based on Western European traditions.&rdquo;</p><p>Those who endorsed the use of violence were then asked about their personal willingness to damage property, threaten or injure someone, or even kill someone to achieve a political objective. Another set of items gauged how likely they were to use a firearm in such a situation, including openly carrying a gun, threatening someone with it, or shooting someone.</p><p>Among the seven forms of prejudice measured, homonegativity was the most prevalent, with 26.6 percent of respondents strongly agreeing with at least one related statement. Racist beliefs were strongly endorsed by 19.5 percent of participants, followed by 16.9 percent for transphobia and 9.8 percent for xenophobia. Hostile sexist views were strongly endorsed by 7.7 percent of respondents, while 5.0 percent expressed strong Islamophobic attitudes. Antisemitism was the least commonly endorsed, but still present, with 2.9 percent of respondents expressing strong agreement.</p><p>The researchers found that strong agreement with each type of prejudice was consistently associated with higher support for political violence. People who strongly agreed with Islamophobic statements, for example, were over 50 percentage points more likely to say that political violence was usually or always justified in at least one scenario. They were also about 12.5 percentage points more likely to say they would be willing to kill someone to achieve a political objective.</p><p>While Islamophobia showed the strongest individual link to violent attitudes, similar patterns were found across all seven forms of prejudice. The least prevalent forms of prejudice&mdash;such as antisemitism&mdash;tended to have the strongest connections to support for violence. In contrast, more commonly held biases like homonegativity had smaller but still significant associations. This pattern suggests that people who strongly endorse rarer prejudices may hold more extreme views overall, which could make them more prone to violent beliefs or behavior.</p><p>When the researchers combined all seven forms of prejudice into a single measure of &ldquo;allophobia,&rdquo; the associations with support for violence became even more pronounced. People who strongly agreed with multiple types of bias were significantly more likely to endorse statements such as &ldquo;The United States needs a civil war to set things right&rdquo; or &ldquo;Our American way of life is disappearing so fast that we may have to use force to save it.&rdquo; These individuals were also more likely to say they would be armed with a gun or even use one against someone in the future, if they believed the political situation warranted it.</p><p>&ldquo;The vast majority of Americans reject these harmful beliefs, just as they reject political violence,&rdquo; said lead author Garen Wintemute. &ldquo;We cannot eradicate such beliefs, but we must work to prevent them from leading to acts of violence.&rdquo;</p><p>The results suggest that people who harbor multiple forms of group-based hostility may pose a particularly high risk for endorsing or engaging in political violence. The authors compare the size of these associations to <a href="https://www.psypost.org/pro-trump-maga-republicans-much-more-likely-to-endorse-delusional-and-pro-violence-statements-study-finds/">what they previously found</a> among supporters of extremist groups like the Proud Boys or QAnon, as well as among people who frequently carry firearms in public.</p><p>Notably, the study also found that phobias were moderately to strongly correlated with each other. For example, people who held xenophobic beliefs were also likely to endorse Islamophobia, while those who expressed transphobic views tended to also agree with hostile sexist statements. This clustering of biases aligns with theories suggesting that people who support group-based hierarchies often generalize their dislike across multiple marginalized groups.</p><p>While the study&rsquo;s findings are based on self-reported attitudes rather than actual behavior, the researchers suggest that such attitudes are meaningful indicators of risk. They argue that people who strongly endorse these prejudices should be considered high-risk not just for targeted hate crimes, but for political violence more broadly. The connection appears to extend beyond group-specific animosity and into a more general willingness to use force in the political realm.</p><p>The authors note that while deep-seated prejudices may be resistant to change, there may still be ways to reduce the risk that these beliefs lead to violence. One approach could be to &ldquo;uncouple&rdquo; hostile beliefs from violent behaviors, possibly by using social pressure or persuasion. For example, previous survey waves have shown that individuals who initially supported the idea of civil war were often willing to reconsider their stance if family members urged them to. In other cases, traditional threat assessment or law enforcement interventions might be necessary.</p><p>The researchers also point to potential policy implications. In particular, they suggest that firearm permitting processes and extreme risk protection orders could take into account evidence of hostility toward marginalized groups, especially when combined with prior threats or violent behavior. California has recently implemented such a policy for its gun violence restraining orders.</p><p>Still, the study has limitations. Because it is cross-sectional, it cannot establish causal relationships. The researchers acknowledge the potential for sampling error, response bias, and other issues common to survey research. Social desirability bias may have led some participants to underreport their support for violence or their prejudiced beliefs. The findings may also have shifted since the time of data collection, given recent events that may influence public opinion.</p><p>The researchers emphasize that their results reflect attitudes held at the population level, rather than predicting any one person&rsquo;s future actions. They argue that identifying clusters of beliefs associated with political violence can help inform prevention strategies and improve public safety.</p><p>The study, &ldquo;<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667193X25002455">Fear, loathing, and support for political violence in the United States: findings from a nationally representative survey</a>,&rdquo; was authored by Garen J.

Research into a possible link has been patchy at best, with a heavy focus on vaccination. However, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2023.106401">a 2023 paper</a> found that menstruation changes are no different between groups distinguished by vaccination.</p><p>In a follow-up investigation, a team led by gynecologist Jacqueline Maybin of the University of Edinburgh in the UK surveyed individuals in the UK who menstruate, comparing those with long COVID (1,048 people), those who had acute COVID-19 (1,716 people), and controls who never contracted COVID-19 at all (9,423 people). These patients answered questions about their menstrual cycles.</p><p>The results showed the most substantial menstrual changes, including longer menstrual periods and abnormal bleeding between periods, in the group with long COVID.</p><p>Patients in this group also reported experiencing more severe long COVID symptoms starting two days before their menstrual period, and continuing for the duration of the period. These symptoms include fatigue, brain fog, memory issues, and post-exertional fatigue.</p><p>The next step was an investigation into what could be causing this. The researchers collected blood serum and endometrial tissue from 10 individuals with long COVID and compared these samples to those from healthy control patients. The results suggest that endometrial inflammation and hormonal disruption play a role in menstrual disruption associated with long COVID.

For a successful replication, the best fitting model had to be trimodal, with comparable components as in Stone et al. Secondary/sensitivity analyses repeated the analysis for different baseline levels of depression severity, imputed values, and patient-reported depression symptoms.</p></div><div><h3>Results</h3><p>The best fitting models were either bimodal or trimodal but the trimodal solution did not meet criteria for replication. The bimodal model had 1 component with HDRS mean change of M = &minus;13.0, SD = 6.7 and included 65.3% of patients, and another component with M = &minus;1.8, SD = 5.1, 34.7%, respectively. For the trimodal model, the component with the largest change (M = &minus;14.3, SD = 6.4) applied to 52% of patients, which differed substantially from the large effect component in Stone et al (M = &minus;18.8, SD = 5.1), which applied to 7.2%. Secondary/sensitivity analyses arrived at similar conclusions, and for patient-reported depression symptoms the best fitting models were unimodal or bimodal.</p></div><div><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>This analysis failed to identify the trimodal distribution of response reported in Stone et al. In addition to being difficult to operationalize for regulatory purposes, results from mixture modeling are not sufficiently reliable to replace the more robust approach of comparing mean differences in depression rating scale scores between treatment arms.</p></div></div><ul><li><li></ul><div><h2>Keywords</h2><p><span>Antidepressants</span></p><p><span>Biases</span></p><p><span>Heterogeneity</span></p><p><span>Average</span></p><p><span>Treatment effect</span></p><p><span>Efficacy</span></p></div><section><h2>Data availability</h2><p>The authors do not have permission to share data.</p></section><section><header><h2>Cited by (0)</h2></header></section><p><span>&copy; 2025 The Author(s).

But a new study now reveals that a common well-regarded eating plan can also have a big positive impact.</p><p>After evaluating 200 hospital patients participating in the <a href="https://directory.biobankinguk.org/Profile/Biobank/GBR-1-384">King's College London Oral, Dental, and Craniofacial Biobank</a>, researchers found that those adhering most closely to a Mediterranean diet had the lowest levels of gum disease. In fact, those on a Mediterranean diet were found to have 65% lower odds of developing severe gum disease than those who adhered to it the least.</p><p>Mediterranean dieters also had less deep gum pockets &ndash; an indicator of gum disease. Those on the diet had an average gum pocket depth of 2.83 mm while the lowest adherents had average pocket depths of 3.29 mm.</p><p>The Mediterranean diet has an emphasis on whole, plant-based foods and healthy fats with limited fish, poultry, and dairy, and very low amounts of red meat. In fact, in their study, the Kings College researchers also found that those who ate the most amount of red meat had nearly three times the risk of severe gum disease than those who ate the least.</p><p>When analyzing blood samples of the participants, the researchers found that those who most highly adhered to the Mediterranean diet had lower levels of a range of inflammatory markers. Conversely, those who ate more red meat had high levels of these markers, including Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP).</p><p>This, they believe, is where the link with the diet and lower gum disease lies. Inflammation is a major trigger of periodontal disease, causing gums to recede and contributing to bone loss in the mouth. Less inflammation, therefore, means less gum disease.</p><p>"We observed that there may be a connection between periodontal disease severity, diet, and inflammation," said Giuseppe Mainas, first author of the study. "These aspects should be holistically considered when assessing the treatment for periodontitis in patients. Our research offers an important starting point that can lead to more research to better understand the relationship between food intake and gum disease."</p><p>The Mediterranean diet's effect in warding off gum disease is just one more tick in an impressive "Pro" column that includes <a href="https://newatlas.com/diet-nutrition/diet-brain-health/">boosting brain organization</a>; <a href="https://newatlas.com/diet-nutrition/diet-fight-diabetes/">fighting diabetes</a>; <a href="https://newatlas.com/depression-diet-dash-mediterranean/53559/">battling depression</a>; <a href="https://newatlas.com/health-wellbeing/diets-ranked-heart-health/">improving heart health</a>; and more.</p><p>"There is emerging evidence about the role that a balanced diet might have in maintaining a periodontal healthy status," concluded research lead, Luigi Nibali. "Our research shows the potential effect that a nutrient-dense, plant-rich diet could play in improving the nation&rsquo;s gum health. Nevertheless, more investigation is needed to develop personalized approaches to help people manage their gum health."</p><p>The study has been published in the <a href="https://aap.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jper.70016"><i>Journal of Periodontology</i></a>.</p><p>Source: <a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/">King's College London</a> via <a href="http://eurekalert.org/news-releases/1097992eval">EurekAlert</a></p></div></section><section class='separator separator-before-comments'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='comments'><p>Top comments</p><ol><li><div class="md"><p>Could it be just a correlation?
