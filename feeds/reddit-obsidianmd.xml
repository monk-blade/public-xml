The beauty of Bear. The productivity of Evernote. The extensibility of Obsidian.</em></p><p>After countless hours of work and huge amounts of help from the fantastic Obsidian community ❤️, <strong>Notebook Navigator</strong> is now available for download in the <strong>Obsidian Community Plugin</strong> list!</p><p><strong>Notebook Navigator</strong> is a <strong>user interface replacement</strong> that transforms Obsidian into what can best be described as a mashup of all the best features from <strong>Apple Notes</strong>, <strong>Bear</strong> and <strong>Evernote</strong> but with <strong>tons</strong> of new productivity features that those older applications miss!</p><p><strong>Want to work 100% with tags?</strong> You got it. You have favorite tags, hidden tags, hierarchical tag trees, tag icons, tag colors, quick commands to add and remove tags, drag-to-tag, and so much more, such as the unique <strong>clickable tags</strong> displayed next to each file name. <strong>Show tags on top</strong>, make it your default interface!</p><p><strong>Love folders?</strong> You got it too. You have folder notes, folder icons, folder colors, thumbnail previews, drag-and-drop, quick actions on hover, quick search, show files from subfolders, excluded folders, custom sort orders, custom appearances for each folder, pinned notes, middle-click to open note in new tab, and so much more!</p><p>Do you use <strong>Dataview</strong> or <strong>Templater</strong>? Or do you <strong>develop plugins</strong>? Notebook Navigator has a <strong>comprehensive API</strong> that allows you to retrieve the user&#39;s selected folder, react to navigation changes with event listeners, and pin files - opening up possibilities that Obsidian&#39;s standard API doesn&#39;t provide. Full documentation included!</p><p>Full <strong>theme</strong> and <strong>Style Settings</strong> support! All colors and visual styles are available in the <strong>Style Settings</strong> plugin so you can make Notebook Navigator look and feel just the way you like it! Complete CSS documentation included!</p><p>There is so much work behind this plugin that it is actually difficult just to write down all the features. Did I mention that it’s also super optimized for mobile devices including all phones and tablets? And available in six languages, including RTL! ノート管理の新時代が始まります！让你的笔记焕然一新！</p><p><strong>Notebook Navigator is FREE and open source!</strong></p><p><a href="https://notebooknavigator.com/">https://notebooknavigator.com/</a></p><p>Try it out and let me know if you love using it as much as I do!</p><p><strong>Under the hood</strong>, Notebook Navigator is built for speed. It uses <strong>React</strong> with <strong>TanStack Virtual</strong> to deliver smooth scrolling even with 100,000+ notes. A dual-layer cache system (IndexedDB + RAM cache) provides instant metadata access for all files. It’s touch-optimized, mobile-friendly, and written in clean, type-safe TypeScript with zero ESLint warnings across 35,000 lines of code.</p><p><strong>About myself.</strong> I’m Johan Sanneblad, have a PhD in software development, and have the past decades created over 100 apps and services together with companies like Apple, Electronic Arts, Google, Lego, Microsoft, SKF, Volvo Cars, Yamaha and many others. I love creating small details in software applications and making applications that appear simple but have lots of thoughtful logic under the hood. I use Obsidian every day for my weekly AI newsletter Tech Insights and plan to support and develop <strong>Notebook Navigator</strong> as long as there are people using it. Notebook Navigator is my third Obsidian plugin, I have also developed <strong>Featured Image</strong> and <strong>Pixel Perfect Image</strong>.</p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section><section class='preview-image'><p>&nbsp;</p><img src='https://i.redd.it/ajqh2oz1hcpf1.png' /></section>]]></description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 20:42:37 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nh3izx</link><title>Bases is absolutely awesome for tracking games!

Same with books on Goodreads: rate it, maybe a short review, done. But for games, I need some more features. I like to make notes, add screenshots, artworks, guides, promo material, trailers or manuals from older games.</p><p>Obsidian absolutely nails this. I can basically build my own tracking site. I used to organize everything in a spreadsheet, but this looks so much nicer and is way more dynamic. I have three Bases for games: <em>Beaten</em>, <em>Playing</em>, and <em>Want to Play</em>.</p><p>With the game search plugin they automatically move to <em>Want to Play</em>. I just set the difficulty property (e.g., normal, hard…) when I start playing. It automatically moves into <em>Playing</em>, and once I beat it, I add the beaten date - it moves into <em>Beaten</em>. Seriously, such an awesome feature.</p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section><section class='embedded-media'><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/91t2glko77pf1.png?width=1919&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0d03ef5dfe3a01304ab3eb51c9d1e1408e612fd8" height="1079" width="1919" /></p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/ghlp54jq77pf1.png?width=1919&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=06b0022e68b45cc45edade12a1ca47c52592e228" height="1079" width="1919" /></p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/k8v949as77pf1.png?width=1919&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c9fa973f7f18488c06131065de9a88eb43b145c2" height="1079" width="1919" /></p></section>]]></description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 03:00:47 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ngp5rz</link><title>Here's a formula that can count how many days remained untill birthday (Gallery)</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1ngp5rz/heres_a_formula_that_can_count_how_many_days/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1ngp5rz/heres_a_formula_that_can_count_how_many_days/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p>Reading time: 1 min | <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1ngp5rz/heres_a_formula_that_can_count_how_many_days/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='separator separator-after-permalink'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='selftext'><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><pre><code>((number(  date(today().format(&quot;YYYY&quot;) + &quot;-&quot; + Birthday.format(&quot;MM-DD&quot;)) +  if(date(today().format(&quot;YYYY&quot;) + &quot;-&quot; + Birthday.format(&quot;MM-DD&quot;)) &lt; today(), &quot;1y&quot;, &quot;0y&quot;)) - number(today())) / 86400000).round()</code></pre></div><!-- SC_ON --></section><section class='embedded-media'><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/7z0jcdj6b4pf1.png?width=487&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1c910b9a0057de690dc92097d2f0cd729318a0b0" height="418" width="487" /></p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/lovtni78b4pf1.png?width=505&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=71a72a57f4a865632919f58ffc9dcd909b7aa51d" height="379" width="505" /></p></section>]]></description><pubDate>Sun, 14 Sep 2025 17:14:11 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://v.redd.it/t8paq3xnu1pf1</link><title>I was confused about what is bases so I made this i hop it help other as well.

I&#39;m a senior software engineer which use Obsidian like any other programming IDE and frameworks. I believe that, since it deals with files and content changes, it can be managed in Git perfectly. I outlined the benefits you get from using it this way as well.</p><p>Some would be:</p><ul><li>Multi-vault management.</li><li>Easier setup for a multi-vault system.</li><li>Permanent record of changes and ability to revert.</li><li>Knowledge of Git, which is necessary if you want to start coding.</li><li>Ability to review your content before storing it.</li><li>It doesn’t intervene if you want to have other sync methods alongside. For example cloud sync or Obsidian native sync in parallel.</li><li>It is all completely free.</li></ul><p>If you think it benefits you, here is the link:<br/><a href="https://youtu.be/1dwSj-wTiVc">https://youtu.be/1dwSj-wTiVc</a></p><p>Any comments and feedback are welcome.
