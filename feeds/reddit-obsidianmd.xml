I have spent the <strong>last 10 months</strong> working on an extensive theme with an emphasis on UI craftsmanship and professional typography. </p><p>Velocity is clean, modern and intuitive, yet carries hints and traces of a bygone era of expressive, tactile interface art. It is also a love letter to some of the oldest themes in Obsidian, drawing inspiration from the philosophies behind works such as <strong>Sanctum</strong> and <strong>Primary.</strong></p><p>To give you an idea of the levels of excessive perfectionism put into Velocity, here are some standout fun facts and trivia:</p><ul><li>The theme has <strong>three separate sets of font weights</strong>, one for Windows, macOS and Linux, each designed to compensate for the different anti-aliasing qualities of each platform.</li><li>The headings have micro-adjustments in the form of negative-indent, to ensure that larger headings line up <em>perfectly</em> with the left edge of text paragraphs.</li><li>Performance of modals and menus on Windows devices is improved using a special GPU trick in CSS, giving Velocity best-in-class menu performance despite extensive styling to almost all menus.</li><li><strong>Extensive styling for Bases</strong>, including pill-shaped query filter controls, an intelligent checkered table style that does not flicker when scrolling, and revamped menus that are no longer difficult or painful to navigate.</li><li><strong>And much, much more!</strong></li></ul><p>Velocity is expressly <strong>opinionated</strong> and intentional in its approach to design, which means customization is not the main focus. In return for less freedom in customizing its appearance, what you get is a tailored and refined experience designed to make note-taking pleasant and joyful. What it lacks in color it makes up for in <em>texture</em>, allowing your content and images to vibrantly stand out against tastefully selected shades of silver and gray.</p><p>Simply put, Velocity is a love letter to the UI designs of yesterday, filtered and focused through the context and needs of today. It is a theme that <strong>makes you forget, even if only for a moment, that you&#39;re writing in Obsidian</strong> - and not some paid application.</p><p>Right now the theme has just reached <code>beta</code> levels of completion. That means that although it is fully functional and has both light and dark modes, it is lacking certain features and compatibility which have yet to be developed. For example:</p><ul><li><strong>Mobile/tablet is not yet supported.</strong></li><li><strong>Canvas is not yet styled.</strong></li><li><strong>There are currently no alternate color schemes or preset color accents.</strong></li></ul><p>The above and more will be worked on during the beta, with all of your help and input of course. </p><p>Velocity would not have been possible without the help, support and friendship of countless alpha testers, fellow theme-devs and friends. My sincerest thanks go out to all of you, as well as anyone else who tries out Velocity from here on out!</p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section><section class='preview-image'><p>&nbsp;</p><img src='https://i.redd.it/1np7en2mvmnf1.png' /></section>]]></description><pubDate>Sun, 07 Sep 2025 05:31:51 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://v.redd.it/o987nodnyknf1</link><title>My Vault Layout for Studying Cybersecurity (Video)</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1na5lcu/my_vault_layout_for_studying_cybersecurity/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1na5lcu/my_vault_layout_for_studying_cybersecurity/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p>Reading time: 1 min | <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1na5lcu/my_vault_layout_for_studying_cybersecurity/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='separator separator-after-permalink'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='selftext'><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m still new to this cybersecurity journey but I already realize that I need to stay organized with the ridiculous amount of notes I&#39;ll be taking. I went through a few iterations trying to figure out the best layout for my workflow, but I think I&#39;m finally settled with it, lol. Now  I can keep all of my notes in one place and everything&#39;s easy to find and study from. Let me know what you think :-)  I&#39;d love to see how other cybersecurity folks organize their notes! </p><p>So I just launched 2 Obsidian templates based on my personal cybersecurity vault. You can purchase either one of  them here <a href="https://darastayscurious.io/">https://darastayscurious.io</a>  </p><p>They both contain all of the notes and spaced repetition flashcards I made for the security +, and one also contains acronym flashcards  for the A+ and Network+, cheat sheets for python, bash, and PowerShell and a bunch of templates I created  There are walkthrough videos for each vault so you can see exactly whatâ€™s inside of each.

A common motif I noticed in the graphs people uploaded was that they had peripheral notes that circled around a nucleus with notes linked directly to the nucleus being pushed inward, forming a cell like structure. </p><p>Structure wise, the yellow nodes are meant to be the Er that goes around the nucleus, with the pinkish purple ones being the golgi, the purple blobs are mitochondria and exodt as distinct entities in the cytosol(the blue stuff). The orange filament is meant to be the cytoskelton and the green wrapping is meant to be the membrane. Note that in this particular instance it didn&#39;t wrap around entirely, however it usually does.</p><p>I intended to make this as a passion project to test what I can do with Obsidian as a newbie.
