Here&rsquo;s how we design Obsidian to ensure that the app is a <a href="https://obsidian.md/security">secure and private</a> environment for your<span>&nbsp;</span>thoughts.</p><h3>Less is safer</h3><p>It may sound obvious but the primary way we reduce the risk of supply chain attacks is to avoid depending on third-party code. Obsidian has a low number of dependencies compared to other apps in our category. See a list of open source libraries on <a href="https://help.obsidian.md/credits#Third+party+acknowledgements">our Credits<span>&nbsp;</span>page</a>.</p><p>Features like <a href="https://help.obsidian.md/bases">Bases</a> and <a href="https://help.obsidian.md/plugins/canvas">Canvas</a> were implemented from scratch instead of importing off-the-shelf libraries. This gives us full control over what runs in<span>&nbsp;</span>Obsidian.</p><ul> <li><strong>For small utility functions</strong> we almost always re-implement them in our<span>&nbsp;</span>code.</li> <li><strong>For medium modules</strong> we fork them and keep them inside our codebase if the licenses allows<span>&nbsp;</span>it.</li> <li><strong>For large libraries</strong> like pdf.js, Mermaid, and MathJax, we include known-good, version-locked files and only upgrade occasionally, or when security fixes land. We read release notes, look at upstream changes, and test thoroughly before<span>&nbsp;</span>switching.</li> </ul><p>This approach keeps our dependency graph shallow with few sub-dependencies. A smaller surface area lowers the chance of a malicious update slipping<span>&nbsp;</span>through.</p><h3>What actually ships in the<span>&nbsp;</span>app</h3><p>Only a handful of packages are part of the app you run, e.g. Electron, CodeMirror, moment.js. The other packages help us build the app and never ship to users, e.g. esbuild or<span>&nbsp;</span>eslint.</p><h3>Version pinning and<span>&nbsp;</span>lockfiles</h3><p>All dependencies are strictly version-pinned and committed with a lockfile. The lockfile is the source of truth for builds so we get deterministic installs. This gives us a straightforward audit trail when reviewing<span>&nbsp;</span>changes.</p><p>We do not run postinstall scripts. This prevents packages from executing arbitrary code during<span>&nbsp;</span>installation.</p><h3>Slow, deliberate upgrades</h3><p>When we do dependency updates,<span>&nbsp;</span>we:</p><ol> <li>Read the dependency&rsquo;s changelog<span>&nbsp;</span>line-by-line.</li> <li>Check sub-dependencies introduced by the new<span>&nbsp;</span>version.</li> <li>Diff upstream&nbsp;when the change set is large or<span>&nbsp;</span>risky.</li> <li>Run automated and manual tests&nbsp;across platforms and critical user<span>&nbsp;</span>paths.</li> <li>Commit the new lockfile&nbsp;only after these reviews<span>&nbsp;</span>pass.</li> </ol><p>In practice, we&nbsp;rarely&nbsp;update dependencies because they generally work and do not require frequent changes. When we do, we treat each change as if we were taking a new<span>&nbsp;</span>dependency.</p><h3>Time is a<span>&nbsp;</span>buffer</h3><p>We don&rsquo;t rush upgrades. There is a delay between upgrading any dependency and pushing a release. That gap acts as an early-warning window: the community and security researchers often detect malicious versions quickly. By the time we&rsquo;re ready to ship, the ecosystem has usually flagged any problematic<span>&nbsp;</span>releases.</p><hr><p>No single measure can eliminate supply chain risk. But choosing fewer dependencies, shallow graphs, exact version pins, no postinstall, and a slow, review-heavy upgrade cadence together make Obsidian much less likely to be impacted, and give us a long window to detect problems before code reaches<span>&nbsp;</span>users.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re curious about our broader approach to security, see our <a href="https://obsidian.md/security">security page</a> and past<span>&nbsp;</span>audits.</p></div></article> </section><section class='separator separator-before-comments'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='comments'><p>Top comments</p><ol><li><div class="md"><blockquote><p>Features like <a href="https://help.obsidian.md/bases">Bases</a> and <a href="https://help.obsidian.md/plugins/canvas">Canvas</a> were implemented from scratch instead of importing off-the-shelf libraries.

It acts as a &#39;block&#39; you can sync wherever (kind of like notion).</p><p>Here&#39;s the GitHub repo with all the code, a README, and the release: <a href="https://github.com/uthvah/sync-embeds/tree/1.0.0">https://github.com/uthvah/sync-embeds/tree/1.0.0</a></p><p><strong>How it works in a nutshell:</strong></p><p>Instead of just rendering the text, the plugin creates a hidden, detached editor pane for the embedded note. It then basically &quot;re-parents&quot; the visual part of that editor right into your current note.</p><p>This means you&#39;re not editing a copy, so you&#39;re interacting with a real, live editor instance. Any changes you make are instantly saved to the original file.</p><p><strong>Where things are at:</strong><br/>The plugin is live! It does the core job really well, but there&#39;s one big limitation to be aware of: <strong>most keyboard shortcuts don&#39;t work</strong> when you&#39;re focused on an embed. This is because Obsidian&#39;s hotkeys are tied to the main &quot;active&quot; file, which is still the parent note. Basic text editing is perfect, though.</p><p><strong>Why I&#39;m posting here:</strong><br/>I&#39;d love to get a fresh set of eyes on it from people who use Obsidian every day.</p><p>I&#39;d be super grateful if anyone has thoughts on:</p><ul><li><strong>The Idea:</strong> Is a live, editable embed like this something you&#39;d even find useful? I can see it being cool for dashboards or daily notes, but how would you use it in your workflow?</li><li><strong>The Feel:</strong> Does it feel seamless to you? Any weird visual glitches?</li><li><strong>The Limitation:</strong> The keyboard shortcut issue is the main drawback. Does that make it a deal-breaker for you, or is it manageable for quick edits?</li><li><strong>Features:</strong> I&#39;ve kept it super minimal on purpose for this first release. Is there anything glaringly obvious that&#39;s missing?</li></ul></div><!-- SC_ON --></section><section class='preview-image'><p>&nbsp;</p><img src='https://i.redd.it/9vufcvbtvtpf1.gif' /></section><section class='separator separator-before-comments'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='comments'><p>Top comments</p><ol><li><div class="md"><p>Are you planning on making this a community plugin?
