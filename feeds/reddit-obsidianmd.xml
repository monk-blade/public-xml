That was the only plugin available that lets you change folder icons in Obsidian from downloadable icon packs. <a href="https://github.com/FlorianWoelki/obsidian-iconize/discussions/646">https://github.com/FlorianWoelki/obsidian-iconize/discussions/646</a></p><p>Other plugins for folder icons such as Iconic do not have icon packs and will not get them for a long time, see: <a href="https://github.com/gfxholo/iconic/issues/65#issuecomment-3167693667">https://github.com/gfxholo/iconic/issues/65#issuecomment-3167693667</a></p><p>So what do you do if you want to use folder icons from libraries like:</p><ul><li>Bootstrap Icons</li><li>Font Awesome</li><li>Lucide Icons</li><li>Material Icons</li><li>Phosphor Icons</li><li>RPG Awesome</li><li>And more?!</li></ul><p>As of today, <strong>Notebook Navigator supports all these icon packs</strong> through an extremely modular and flexible architecture! Icons packs are downloaded from the Notebook Navigator repo into a local database on the device. Status flags sync between devices, indicating if a library should be installed or removed, then all devices will automatically install or remove icons from this database. It works almost like magic! And it is VERY easy to extend with more icon packs in the future!</p><p>To install: Open Obsidian, go to Settings, install &quot;Notebook Navigator&quot; from Community Plugins.</p><p>For more information, see <a href="https://notebooknavigator.com/">https://notebooknavigator.com/</a></p><p>Notebook Navigator will only access the icon packs in this folder. Here you will find the icon packs and their sources. <a href="https://github.com/johansan/notebook-navigator/tree/main/icon-assets">https://github.com/johansan/notebook-navigator/tree/main/icon-assets</a></p><p><strong>Other news in version 1.4.20 released today:</strong></p><h1>Improved</h1><ul><li>Tags in list pane are now sorted alphabetically. Tags in file list are sorted as follows: first favorite tags are shown, then colored non-favorite tags, then uncolored non-favorite tags.</li></ul><h1>Changed</h1><ul><li>Metadata cleanup (i.e. the removal of settings related to files, tags or folders that no longer exist in the vault) is no longer done automatically during startup. This should improve settings sync for Notebook Navigator on slower sync services (like Onedrive). Instead you can now cleanup metadata manually in Settings under the Advanced section.</li><li>Show tooltips setting (desktop) is now disabled by default, based on user feedback.</li></ul><h1>Fixed</h1><ul><li>Notebook Navigator will now properly scroll to the selected ancestor folder during startup (a problem introduced in 1.4.18 when we fixed another issue with auto reveal).</li><li>Finally fixed ClearType rendering fuzzyness on Windows by removing GPU transforms from virtualized list rows.</li></ul></div><!-- SC_ON --></section><section class='preview-image'><p>&nbsp;</p><img src='https://i.redd.it/x9nr75pct6qf1.png' /></section><section class='separator separator-before-comments'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='comments'><p>Top comments</p><ol><li><div class="md"><p>Are you a saint?!</p><p>Well done!</p><p>❤️Thank you for your hard work!🫡</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1nlft14/notebook_navigator_1420_is_now_the_only/nf55t3i/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><div class="md"><p>notebook navigator deserves plugin of the year</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1nlft14/notebook_navigator_1420_is_now_the_only/nf5dsuv/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><div class="md"><p>Wow you are just FLYING with this plugin.

I often felt like the amount of time I spent working on it wasn’t worth the results it yielded. I didn’t use the graph view a whole lot and connecting notes was helpful, but I never actually did anything with these connections besides just keeping them in my vault. </p><p>Idk if it’s the adhd or what but I struggle greatly with determining what is or isn’t important when I’m taking notes, so I had a really hard time determining how granular I wanted each note to be. It was a constant thought process of “Do I put the whole chapter in this note? Turn each individual chapter of the section into notes? Do definitions become their own notes? Does this connection of ideas become its own note or just stay here in this current note?” and it was just very overwhelming since I don’t have an internal voice intuitively telling me “Yes this is important. No this isn’t important” so I had to think of these decisions for every single note and it was exhausting.</p><p>I also handwrite a lot of my notes because it helps me remember and understand the information more, as I find that I’ll literally forget the information immediately if I don’t write it down. Typing didn’t help me learn much and converting my old notes into pdfs then into the vault was such a hassle.</p><p>I think my old vault mostly failed because I didn’t have a specific reason for using obsidian. I quit because it felt purposeless and I didn’t have a reason for doing all of this work when I can just use my old handwritten notes like usual. I’m not the type of person to reread my notes since I mainly use them for understanding a concept in the moment. So if I want a refresher I’ll just return to the source material anyway.</p><p>However, now that I’m diving into photography I’m considering picking it up again as I find the visuals of mind mapping really helps me come up with new photography ideas. There’s something about seeing all the concepts so easily on a single screen, then being able to visually bounce between them quickly and easily, that just really helps me find new relationships and connections between ideas. I was thinking if just 20 minutes of starting with a blank page and mind mapping helps me come up with photography ideas, then can you imagine what months of different ideas and starting points would do for generating ideas? </p><p>I also find this mind map of seeing everything approach helpful for learning since when I’m studying a topic I quickly forget what previous concepts were, but if I have a visual of all the main concepts of previous chapters then I can easily see the relationship between things and understand the concept on a whole new level as I’m learning the new concepts and connecting them to old ones.</p><p>The thing is would obsidian be the most efficient use case for my goals or not? I think it would help with the generating photography ideas part, but I’m very unsure about using it for the learning part.</p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section><section class='separator separator-before-comments'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='comments'><p>Top comments</p><ol><li><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve written about when to split a note here: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1cgkccy/atomic_notes_or_long_notes_when_you_should_split/">https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1cgkccy/atomic_notes_or_long_notes_when_you_should_split/</a></p><p>To make it short, when you&#39;re reusing part of the note more than once or when you&#39;re sure you&#39;ll use it more than once, split it into a new note.

Between Canvas (core-plugin) and Excalidraw (community-plugin) you’ve got a solid visualization tool for mind mapping without being too cumbersome. I find the “Linking” functionality very powerful when it comes to thought dumping and organizing topics (usually through a M.O.C.). With the new Bases feature: cataloging lens and camera types is super easy, just to scratch the surface of their database views.</p><p>It could also be antithetical to your goals and workflows. Like with most digital (customizable) note-taking apps, it is very easy to get sucked into the complexities of the app… especially if you frequent the subreddit. Maybe your daily routine and workflows make it difficult to use it consistently. Perhaps the tactile-ness of a pocket book or bullet journal is the better option.</p><p>My progression went from: school notebooks → OneNote → Legal Pad mind maps → Bullet Journal → Pocket Notebook → OneNote → Monday → Notion → Obsidian… over the course of a decade. I still don’t have it all down perfect, still trying to find the work/home divide. But as of now, I have a feeling like Obsidian (.txt files in general) might finally be the thing that sticks for me.</p><p>I hope your journey is a lot quicker than mine. Good luck finding that combo that just feels right.</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1nkny0g/using_obsidian_for_massive_mind_mapping/nezov8q/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><div class="md"><p>One idea per note.</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1nkny0g/using_obsidian_for_massive_mind_mapping/nezj2pq/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><div class="md"><p>If it&#39;s for academic and/or researching purposes, in most cases you should write the note in your own words or your vault will become a copy paste dump. This will ofc slow you down while taking in the note, but will be more useful later on. This applies for ideas and stuff which involves understanding. For pure info dumping you can&#39;t avoid copy-pasting ofc.</p><p>Core plugin Canvas will probably be a good tool for you as you can freely place images in it and also create mindmaps-like structures. Community plugin Better Canvas might be helpful here. Or maybe there&#39;s a more dedicated mindmap plugin out there, dunno.</p><p>BTW, you can reference to specific headers in your note if needed. I don&#39;t think you need an extra note for each definition. Probably, if needed, just link it to the specific definition section in your note - that will suffice.</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1nkny0g/using_obsidian_for_massive_mind_mapping/nezsfr2/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t have a suggestion, but tagging in here to get notifications as the situation you are describing could literally be me (except the photography part)</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1nkny0g/using_obsidian_for_massive_mind_mapping/nf0zpg3/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p></li></ol></section>]]></description><pubDate>Fri, 19 Sep 2025 05:05:46 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1nkhr3z/anyone_long_term_stuck_with_obsidian_as_main_note/</link><title>Anyone long term stuck with Obsidian as main note app?</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1nkhr3z/anyone_long_term_stuck_with_obsidian_as_main_note/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1nkhr3z/anyone_long_term_stuck_with_obsidian_as_main_note/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p>Reading time: 1 min | <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1nkhr3z/anyone_long_term_stuck_with_obsidian_as_main_note/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='separator separator-after-permalink'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='selftext'><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Obsidian is great and love all the customization.

For example, if I&#39;m reading an article that says that Claudia Gorbman (reference to 1987 book) said something, in my notes, I will link Claudia&#39;s name instead of the book.</p><p>Surely I can fix it if I change my mindset to link the book instead, but here&#39;s the second problem: if I&#39;m creating a link for a new book that I have no note for yet, when I reach the point to read this book, I&#39;ll probably forget about the link and create a new note. So, while the &quot;lost link&quot; is probably only the book&#39;s name, the new note will follow the &quot;name (author, year)&quot; scheme.</p><p>Thus, everything is still unconnected since there&#39;s no note for the book, only the lost link. Surely, again, I can always create the new files when linking (following my own scheme), but I don&#39;t want to fill up my vault with files that I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m going to need. Also, sometimes, this new step of searching for the book/article name and year in the middle of a note-taking session can be really distracting — since the a literature I&#39;m reading only says author&#39;s name and year of the reference. </p><p>So, what I notice from some videos and articles about Obsidian within academia is that fellows usually name their notes with: &quot;author name (year)&quot;. (Which makes sense, since an author is always related to the work they made: I will never say Gorbman said something outside a book or article). However, I&#39;m not sure if this is the &quot;best way&quot; — ik there&#39;s no general best way, but bear with me — and if there is any &quot;negative factor&quot; to it. </p><p>So, how do you guys handle it? </p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section><section class='separator separator-before-comments'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='comments'><p>Top comments</p><ol><li><div class="md"><p>I use Properties, mainly Aliases (alternative file names): your file [[Unheard Melodies (Claudia Gorbman, 1987)]] could have an alias of &#39;Gorbman&#39; and/or &#39;Gorbman 1987&#39;, &#39;Claudia Gorbman&#39;, etc. (as many as you want).

It acts as a &#39;block&#39; you can sync wherever (kind of like notion).</p><p>Here&#39;s the GitHub repo with all the code, a README, and the release: <a href="https://github.com/uthvah/sync-embeds/tree/1.0.0">https://github.com/uthvah/sync-embeds/tree/1.0.0</a></p><p><strong>How it works in a nutshell:</strong></p><p>Instead of just rendering the text, the plugin creates a hidden, detached editor pane for the embedded note. It then basically &quot;re-parents&quot; the visual part of that editor right into your current note.</p><p>This means you&#39;re not editing a copy, so you&#39;re interacting with a real, live editor instance. Any changes you make are instantly saved to the original file.</p><p><strong>Where things are at:</strong><br/>The plugin is live! It does the core job really well, but there&#39;s one big limitation to be aware of: <strong>most keyboard shortcuts don&#39;t work</strong> when you&#39;re focused on an embed. This is because Obsidian&#39;s hotkeys are tied to the main &quot;active&quot; file, which is still the parent note. Basic text editing is perfect, though.</p><p><strong>Why I&#39;m posting here:</strong><br/>I&#39;d love to get a fresh set of eyes on it from people who use Obsidian every day.</p><p>I&#39;d be super grateful if anyone has thoughts on:</p><ul><li><strong>The Idea:</strong> Is a live, editable embed like this something you&#39;d even find useful? I can see it being cool for dashboards or daily notes, but how would you use it in your workflow?</li><li><strong>The Feel:</strong> Does it feel seamless to you? Any weird visual glitches?</li><li><strong>The Limitation:</strong> The keyboard shortcut issue is the main drawback. Does that make it a deal-breaker for you, or is it manageable for quick edits?</li><li><strong>Features:</strong> I&#39;ve kept it super minimal on purpose for this first release. Is there anything glaringly obvious that&#39;s missing?</li></ul></div><!-- SC_ON --></section><section class='preview-image'><p>&nbsp;</p><img src='https://i.redd.it/9vufcvbtvtpf1.gif' /></section><section class='separator separator-before-comments'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='comments'><p>Top comments</p><ol><li><div class="md"><p>Are you planning on making this a community plugin?

Right now i am using the following dataviewJS script, but if sync was able to improve my current implementation and make the callouts editable... 👌</p><pre><code>const pages = dv.pages().filter(f =&gt; f.file.folder == dv.current().file.folder);const regex = /&gt;[ \t]*\[\!nota\][ \t]*(.*)(?:\n&gt;[ \t]?.*)*/g;let any = false;for (const page of pages) {    const file = app.vault.getAbstractFileByPath(page.file.path);    const contents = await app.vault.read(file);    for (const m of contents.matchAll(regex)) {        if (!any) dv.header(4, &quot;&quot;)        let wrapper = dv.el(&quot;div&quot;, &quot;&quot;);        let callout = dv.paragraph(m[0])        wrapper.appendChild(callout);        let calloutEl = wrapper.querySelector(&quot;div.callout&quot;);        if (calloutEl) {            calloutEl.style.position = &quot;relative&quot;;            calloutEl.style.marginBlock = &quot;1rem&quot;;            const link = dv.el(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;🔗&quot;);            link.href = &quot;#&quot;;            link.style = &quot;position: absolute; top: 0.9rem; right: 1.1rem; text-decoration: none;&quot;;            link.addEventListener(&quot;click&quot;, (e) =&gt; {                e.preventDefault();                app.workspace.getLeaf().openFile(file);            });            calloutEl.appendChild(link);        }        any = true;    }}</code></pre><p>Thanks in advance, and congratulations for such an awesome project!!</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1njvm7x/i_made_a_plugin_for_live_editable_note_embeds_any/neuss0m/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve ALWAYS  been looking forward to a plugin like this, as I really enjoy the &quot;Sync block&quot; feature in Notion.</p><p>I&#39;ll give it a try it, thank you for developing it!

The processes are different. At the very least, create two separate vaults — one for showcasing and one for note-taking.</p><p>(I personally keep one large vault where I collect all kinds of notes, not just writing-related ones.) In this working vault, you can create notes, link them, Q&amp;As about your world, and more. But don’t focus on making it look polished — instead, focus on keeping it flexible and easy to use. Avoid installing too many plugins. I only use a very selective few. Most of the time, I mainly use two core plugin -  Canvas and Bases.</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1njq3mv/obsidian_for_worldbuilding/neuocdg/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p></li></ol></section>]]></description><pubDate>Thu, 18 Sep 2025 03:08:48 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://i.redd.it/h5z8ob7yespf1.png</link><title>37 000 downloads in 2 days!

The Obsidian Web Clipper Chrome extension is great for capturing content off the Web, but when it comes to using it with Gmail, it doesn&#39;t capture emails. I searched around for an alternate solution and found none. Then in a few hours, I developed a Chrome extension that does exactly what I needed.</p><p>If you have any feedback, please DM me - thank you!</p><p>I hope that you find this extension helpful!</p><p><strong>Setup:</strong></p><p>After installation, click on the extensions icon to view your installed extensions, then click on the pin next to &quot;Gmail2Obsidian&quot; to add it to your browser tool bar. </p><p><strong>Options:</strong></p><p>Next, you&#39;ll want to open the OPTIONS for Gmail2Obsidian. Right click on the Gmail2Obsidian icon and select Options.</p><p>* Obsidian Vault Name - enter the name of your Obsidian Vault</p><p>* Obsidian Default Note Folder - this is the folder you will export your emails to.</p><p>* Gmail Body Selector(s) - leave the default values. You will only need to change this if Gmail suddenly changes the format of emails. This allows you to continue using the extension until I&#39;ve identified the change and release an update.</p><p>* Gmail Subject Selector - leave the default value. You will only need to change this if Gmail suddenly changes the format of emails. This allows you to continue using the extension until I&#39;ve identified the change and release an update.</p><p>* Include YAML frontmatter - this generates the details/properties of the email at the top of the note that is sent to Obsidian. This includes: Title, Source, Source URL, exported timestamp, from name, from email, email date local, email date iso format, participants and their emails.</p><p>* Include hidden quoted history (in Gmail &#39;...&#39;) - Recommended that you not turn this on. This will capture quoted emails which are often copies of emails within the tread.</p><p>* Strip &quot;On...wrote&quot; sections inside each message - helps ensure that quoted/repeated content is not saved in the exported email.</p><p>* Limit to last N messages - just in case you have long email threads and wish to truncate after a number of messages. Default is &#39;0&#39; for All messages.</p><p><strong>NOTE: when you want to export an email &#39;thread,&#39; first click on each email in the thread you want included, which will expand each email, then click on the icon to export.</strong></p><p>Thank you for your time and attention.

It will allow you see the author of each book in the Library view</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1njlaec/will_obsidian_bases_have_relations/ner451v/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><div class="md"><p>I would like if it did, I think it would be nice for my genealogy notes.</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1njlaec/will_obsidian_bases_have_relations/nevlhih/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><div class="md"><p>Check this forum post to have a list of backlinks in your base.
