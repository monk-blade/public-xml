Some pointed out I was taking the term too literally, but that’s exactly how mainstream media and productivity gurus have framed it as if it can think for you. That smart framing masks the fact that, for most people, it often just becomes a glorified storage system.</p><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/s/xNf0KNjPPE">https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/s/xNf0KNjPPE</a></p><p>I also touched on the idea of local LLMs. Opinions there were divided. Some saw them as the next evolution of a second brain, while others felt it was overkill or unnecessary. That post resonated with some and felt like an attack to others, which was interesting in itself.</p><p>Since then, I’ve been diving deeper into the original concept of PKMS, where the K stands for knowledge meaning processed, distilled ideas and thoughts in your own words. This made me reflect on how the “second brain” movement we see today often diverges from that principle. What’s sold as a second brain frequently ends up being a massive collection of articles, PDFs, highlights, videos, and quotes not actual knowledge.</p><p>With that in mind, I have some follow-up questions for those of you who are currently using, or have used, this glorified, half-baked PKMS (myself included):</p><pre><code>1.  The notes you store in your vault how many of them are actually processed knowledge, your own summaries and ideas, versus external material like articles, PDFs, quotes, or YouTube videos?2.  How often does your vault truly help you connect ideas into bigger insights, rather than just storing information? Or do you notice yourself falling into apophenia, forcing connections just to feel like the system is working?3.  Are we maintaining these systems because they genuinely help us think, or are we caught in the sunk cost fallacy, holding onto the system simply because we’ve already invested so much effort?4.  When you look back at your vault, does it feel more like a storage unit of unprocessed material, bordering on the hoarding fallacy?5.  How much time do you spend organizing and reorganizing notes instead of actually adding new material or rewriting previous notes?6.  For anyone who has tried atomic-style notes or the PARA method (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives), do these approaches feel more practical and sustainable than chasing the “second brain” ideal?</code></pre><p>I’m curious to hear your experiences. The goal isn’t to dismiss tools like Obsidian they’re amazing but to understand whether the “second brain” as marketed actually delivers on its promise of helping us think better, or if it’s mostly a system for accumulation.</p><p>The reason for this post is to help me gather mass perception and insights from real users, which will support my research for an article I’m writing on the psychology and reality of second brain systems. As of now it’s like think less ‘Collect everything’.</p><p>P.S. No need to answer all the questions. Always open to your personal thoughts and insights on the matter.</p><p>Wishing you Blue skies and Tailwinds.</p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section>]]></description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Sep 2025 02:16:26 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1nbtzcl/does_anyone_know_if_the_source_code_for_obsidians/</link><title>Does anyone know if the source code for Obsidian’s CEO (or something similar) is publicly available?</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1nbtzcl/does_anyone_know_if_the_source_code_for_obsidians/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1nbtzcl/does_anyone_know_if_the_source_code_for_obsidians/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p>Reading time: 1 min | <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1nbtzcl/does_anyone_know_if_the_source_code_for_obsidians/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='separator separator-after-permalink'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='selftext'><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, I really like Steph&#39;s website: <a href="https://stephango.com/">https://stephango.com/</a>.

One thing that I want to achieve is to use bases to manage tasks that cannot fit within a single line. I will have a note writing down the subtasks that needs to be done, and also jot down work log as I move along.</p><p>With Bases, I can quickly surface a base with all of the tasks in a table, but I want to see the overall progress of this bigger task. As a developer myself, I am taking this matter with my own hands and I quickly put together a very small plugin that updates the number of tasks in a note into the property, so I can set up a formula in the base to see the progress!</p><p>Right now the plugin is very bare and does not have any configurations, it will automatically operate on notes with <code>#task</code> in the tags property as you open them or operate the tasks using the Task plugin, and the counts will be written into the <code>progress</code> property of the same note. But I will be updating the plugin to provide configurations and when I am ready, I will submit as a community plugin. For now if any of you are in similar needs and want to try it out, you can download it via BRAT from this <a href="https://github.com/lhr0909/obsidian-plugin-task-properties">plugin GitHub repository</a>.

It has helped me immensely, and I think it is a great tool for the type of organisation system that works best for me, which is something between GTD and the BUJO approach. I had a decent graphing thing going on with the tasks plugin but then, one day, it all stopped feeling rewarding an I stopped. I currently still use it as a way to write down daily to-do&#39;s but I&#39;ve lost the dopamine-spark. So, asking the ADHD-ers in this community:</p><ul><li>What are some ways you have built dopamine/rewards into your task management system? Counting/graphing is one thing that works for me</li><li>How are you incorporating colours and colour-coding into your workflows?</li><li>Any clever ways to show you only a couple of tasks, potentially based on properties? I know how filters work, I just have not found the AHA way of it only showing me for example 3 tasks and a new task being shown once I have finished one</li><li>Any other brilliant or gamification tips?
