I will keep this post updated with any new information regarding the plugin.</p><p>Update 2:With the Spotify requirements, to use this plugin you will need Spotify Premium and Developer. I do have a repo made and will have it available by Monday afternoon for testing if anyone is interested. </p><p>Update 3:Here is the GitHub link for those who want to test version 1. <a href="https://github.com/Kebbrokk/Obsidian-Spotify-Playback.git">https://github.com/Kebbrokk/Obsidian-Spotify-Playback.git</a>Note this is a concept version, there’s bound to be bugs and glitches. </p><p>If you have any questions, suggestions or thoughts please leave them on the GitHub page.
