President Trump signed a proclamation imposing an annual $100,000 fee per H-1B visa. The goal is to encourage training and hiring of American workers instead of bringing foreign workers taking jobs.</p><ul><li><strong>Who is impacted?</strong> Employers hiring H-1B workers face a large fee increase ($100,000 per year per visa), which could discourage hiring lower-skilled tech workers. The proclamation does not impact students on F1, J1 visas, OPT, visitor visas (B1, B2), other visas, or immigrant visas including Green Cards.</li><li><strong>How does this impact foreign students in America?</strong> It does not directly impact students on F1, M-1, J1, or OPT visas, but the dream of staying and working in the U.S. is affected. Employers will be reluctant to pay the $100,000 fee unless the graduate is exceptional.</li><li><strong>How does this impact employers hiring H-1B workers?</strong>The cost for employers rises by $100,000 annually per worker. Large companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta already use large numbers of H-1B visas, so this significantly increases their expenses.</li><li><strong>How does this impact software services companies?</strong> Offshore IT and service companies that send workers to the U.S. on H-1B visas are affected because the cost model changes with the new fee, impacting their business.</li><li><strong>How does it impact existing H-1B visa holders?</strong> The announcement is unclear on existing visa holders, but companies are cautious. Renewals will be more expensive, and students on OPT looking for work visas might feel the impact.</li><li><strong>Do H-1B candidates need to be exceptional?</strong> Yes, companies now must spend significantly more (potentially half a million dollars over 4-5 years on fees, in addition to salaries) to sponsor H-1B workers, so candidates need to be exceptional to justify this cost.</li><li><strong>Will this impact offshore IT jobs?</strong> Currently, offshore jobs may not be directly impacted, though companies sending workers offshore will see an impact. Global Competency Centers (GCCs) may also feel effects.</li><li><strong>Why now?</strong> This move is supported by leaders of top tech companies to boost domestic investment in AI and technology. Trump emphasized hiring more American workers and training them. The fee penalty aims to make companies reconsider hiring foreign workers long term.</li></ul><p>Edit - I see 50% downvotes ... shooting the messnenger here or the policy?</p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section><section class='embedded-media'><iframe width="356" height="200" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SVATc3AjlMk?feature=oembed&enablejsapi=1" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen title="Trump imposes $100K H-1B visa fee from Sept 21 - Most extensive FAQ  What, Why and impct on families"></iframe></section><section class='separator separator-before-comments'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='comments'><p>Top comments</p><ol><li><div class="md"><p>Step 1: Defund the universities, which provide skilled US labor, lowering supply</p><p>Step 2: Make it harder for foreigners to get in</p><p>Step 3: ???</p><p>Step 4: Discover AI can&#39;t replace people in highly skilled jobs</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1nlsm0z/an_extensive_faq_on_trumps_announcement_about_h1b/nf7y11x/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><div class="md"><p>This will <em>absolutely, without any doubt in my mind</em> result in companies immediately investing <em>far harder</em> towards offshoring.</p><p>This is going to fucking murder the US tech sector.</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1nlsm0z/an_extensive_faq_on_trumps_announcement_about_h1b/nf7rc5e/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><div class="md"><p>As a Eastern European working in IT often for US companies, FUCK YEAH!

My experience is most H1B hires are competent and paid well. What they often do that many non-visa hires don&#39;t is live to work. Many are here to work for their 3-6 year stint, don&#39;t bring their families and are willing to focus w/ work as priority #1. They don&#39;t complain about working 50+ hours a week, being asked to work weekends, etc... I think that is what drives a lot of companies to pursue hires that are competent, but not exceptional.</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1nlsm0z/an_extensive_faq_on_trumps_announcement_about_h1b/nf8g9so/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><div class="md"><p>I’m worried about the impact this will have on the sciences, which traditionally rely upon free movement of talent around the globe.

They harm honest companies that bring highly skilled people by making thousands of these low skilled people apply, knowing that a small portion will get through but it reduces the chance of highly skilled people that are genuinely hard to come by from working in the US.</p><p>Luckily, some multinationals can tap into worldwide talent using local branches and relocation after a year of local work using the L1 visa. It&#39;s much less used by abusive companies.</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1nlsm0z/an_extensive_faq_on_trumps_announcement_about_h1b/nf7vl30/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p></li></ol></section>]]></description><pubDate>Sat, 20 Sep 2025 13:49:22 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/nri/work/microsoft-urges-h-1b-visa-holders-to-stay-in-us-for-foreseeable-future-after-trump-announces-100000-visa-fee/articleshow/124009637.cms?from=mdr</link><title>Microsoft asks all its foreign staff to return to US by Sunday after Trump's H1-B bombshell (economictimes.indiatimes.com)</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1nlqi0c/microsoft_asks_all_its_foreign_staff_to_return_to/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1nlqi0c/microsoft_asks_all_its_foreign_staff_to_return_to/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1nlqi0c/microsoft_asks_all_its_foreign_staff_to_return_to/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='separator separator-before-comments'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='comments'><p>Top comments</p><ol><li><div class="md"><p>I know of some ISP managers that are sweating profusely right now.</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1nlqi0c/microsoft_asks_all_its_foreign_staff_to_return_to/nf7geq7/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><div class="md"><p>Are we going to start seeing vids of ICE raiding Silicon Valley?</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1nlqi0c/microsoft_asks_all_its_foreign_staff_to_return_to/nf7yo35/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><div class="md"><p>Wondering what impact this will have on Europe, knowing the EU they will react in about 7 years. </p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1nlqi0c/microsoft_asks_all_its_foreign_staff_to_return_to/nf7hzl3/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><div class="md"><p>Wouldn’t that mean they have to pay the H1B thing.

Even with AI assistance it took a lot of trouble shooting to remain as true as possible to the original language as I could.</p><p>BUT DOES IT HAVE...? Yes, there&#39;s a list at the bottom.</p><p>Terry Davis&#39; story is fascinating and I was contemplating making a documentary about him but I figured that in order to get inside his head I should learn HolyC, and then I should make a port, and now ... I think the CIA is following me (kidding).</p><p>This is not even close to finished but it will compile simple programs as windows executables. Running something like  <code>schismc.exe hellorld.hc</code> also works (as well as the ASM output) but there are limitations. I was more concerned with staying true to HolyC than I was with absolute practical functionality.</p><p>There is a lot more work to do, and, to be honest, adding in some sort of graphical component to this scares the living crap out of me - I mean, in Windows? Come on. There really hasn&#39;t been any significant testing with command line changes to the running program as of yet either.</p><p>WHY: Why would you do something like this? There is no monetary or practical reason for doing something like this. I jsut did.</p><p>WHAT&#39;S UP WITH THE NAME? IFKYK - but you know a separation form the HolyC would be a ...</p><p>WHY WINDOWS, WHY NOT LINUX?: Okay, I get this one a lot ... simply put, I did most of this work late at night when I am writing scripts (the movie kind, not the python kind, ironic that, huh?) so I was able to easily switch back and forth when my brain need a break from one I would switch to the other. Windows is the OS I write film scripts in so that&#39;s what I ported to and what I typically write for anyway. Most of my little apps are solutions for filmmaking problems.</p><p>HOW: Originally I began by pulling everything I knew about the language, looking at the code and hand coding what I could. I ran into too many brick walls that I could not get past. I understood the concepts but the Windows (screw PE) part of the equation was too much and assembly was kicking my butt.

Note that, however, each application is trusted and at some point the DB becomes an integration point that cannot be subject to splitting and parallelization, so you have to have those things in place somehow before you commence development. This involves setting up the schema and things like stored procedures to abstract out certain operations, so you don&#39;t end up with a dozen slightly different interpretations of the same thing.</p><p>However, plenty of apps just don&#39;t need that and their development can be centralized. In that case the RDBMS is more of a simple data store. It can even be replaced with an embedded database or multiple embedded databases plus application-level coordination. You have a single monolith and it&#39;s definitely possible and desirable to avoid the impedance mismatch and code everything in the application.</p><p>There&#39;s also the option to have multiple services that call each other. However the tricky bit there is doing stuff like cross-service queries and transactions, if you end up needing those. And, really, you often do unless you&#39;re dealing with totally separate things that stand on their own.</p><p>Anyway, so far this mostly touches upon data access without regard for permissions. There are multiple ways to see permissions. One is as coordinated cross-service logic which ensures consistency and prevents mistakes, e.g. some service won&#39;t end up allowing data access where it shouldn&#39;t. This is an extension of what I said above. Another is dealing with totally untrusted 3rd parties, but this typically tends to be out of scope for RDBMSes (you don&#39;t open up your PostgreSQL to the world).</p><p>What I&#39;m trying to say is it&#39;s more important that the choice of how you do it is consistent with how you develop things. If you end up outsourcing building three components to three different vendors and they <em>somehow</em> have to arrive at the same permissions logic, that&#39;s clearly going to be a pain point. But aside from potential consequences, this really isn&#39;t very different from other bits of shared logic. Which you need to centralize somewhere at some level.</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1nkm5rc/application_vs_database_where_should_permissions/nezj9ao/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><div class="md"><p>What I&#39;ve usually done is roles and list of permissions or actions are stored on the database, as well as relationships between roles and users and permissions, but it is of course within the app itself where you define authorization. Who can access what if they have these permissions. This way you control who gets what permissions easily (and can even build a UI for that) and what permissions can do in the system. </p><p>If it&#39;s just the database then  you still have to manage those checks within the database, so it&#39;s no different from the application code, and you lack a lot of nuance such as user can access data for this application but they can&#39;t see the associated files for it, for example. I bet it&#39;s a lot more complicated to manage those permissions within the database than it is in the code.</p><p>Just don&#39;t hardcode roles and permissions. You&#39;re gonna regret it once the system grows.</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1nkm5rc/application_vs_database_where_should_permissions/nf140gn/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think there&#39;s one right answer on this.  It depends a lot on the application, problem domain and typical usage patterns.</p><p>To give one example, RLS generally means having each user represented by an account in the database.  There are wins here IMO, especially with the upcoming OAuth support in Postgres 18, as you&#39;ll be able to have an external service like keycloak managing authentication for both the database and the front end, with all the permissions defined in the database.  Good good.</p><p>But having individual database accounts stops you from using effective connection pooling.  Now, half the people reading this are thinking, &quot;Yep, that&#39;s a complete killer.  Don&#39;t even bother thinking about it.&quot;  The other half are thinking, &quot;So what?&quot;  They&#39;re each aware that the other exists and both think the others are idiots.  But they both have a point.</p><p>See, the first type write web applications which typically have many users and short interactions.  New users arrive all the time, do a couple of things, then disappear and are replaced by a new user.  Connection pooling is a big win for them.</p><p>The other type write enterprise applications where one person logs in at the start of the day and sits there for hours on end entering and looking up data.  For them, giving each user a database connection that stays open all day probably isn&#39;t that big a deal and is justified by the other benefits.

Supposedly it has all these edge cases which can bite you, but I&#39;d never know -- the non-edge cases bite me way before I can get to those. I hate yaml so much. </p><p>Regarding KSON, there&#39;s a lot of great stuff there:</p><ul><li>Comments! I want to smack everyone who says that json shouldn&#39;t have comments because it&#39;s just for transport. No. Just no. Its history and original intent do not matter to me in the slightest. It is a configuration format and ought to have the option for human readable comments (and forgiveness of trailing commas).</li><li>Your embedded block appears to support new lines with actual new lines instead of metacharacters. This is another pain-point in json that I would love to see fixed</li><li>Easy to read yaml-like trees. The only thing yaml has going for it in my experience is this format. It&#39;s so much easier on the eyes</li><li>Java and javascript support. It&#39;s impossible to overstate the importance of lowering the barrier to entry for things like this. That said, it needs python and C# if you want it to be considered for the rest of us</li><li>json superset. Another &#39;lowering the barrier to entry&#39; piece of magic. Telling me that 100% of my old config files still work is wonderful</li></ul><p>There&#39;s also some bad things:</p><ul><li>Allowing strings without requiring single or dbl-quotes is eventually going to get you right back into yaml nightmare territory. false != &quot;false&quot;, 0 != &quot;0&quot;, 0.0 != &quot;0.0&quot;. Maybe this won&#39;t matter to the pythons and luas out there, but to strongly typed c#/.net folks, this matters</li><li>Code blocks. If you ever put code in my config files, we&#39;re gunna fight. There&#39;s so much possibility for bad here. Turing complete opens up a can of worms, not the least of which is unexpected runtime or memory use when you&#39;re just trying to use your config file</li><li><code>&#39;(1 + √.5)/2&#39;</code> is not a number, it&#39;s a calculation. See above</li><li>Not sure how I feel about <code>π</code> as a number. I&#39;m inclined against it because there&#39;s no way to know how it will interact with your language of choice until trial and error.

WASM 3.0 brings some game-changing features. The memory64 support alone opens up possibilities for running memory-intensive applications that were previously impossible. What excites me most is the improved SIMD support - this could make WebAssembly genuinely competitive with native code for compute-heavy tasks like image processing and ML inference. For those building cross-platform tools, the combination of exception handling and better debugging support will dramatically improve developer experience.

The idea is simple: keep <strong>UUIDv7</strong> internally for database indexing and sortability, but emit <strong>UUIDv4-looking façades</strong> externally so clients don’t see timing patterns.</p><p>How it works: the 48-bit timestamp is XOR-masked with a keyed <strong>SipHash-2-4</strong> stream derived from the UUID’s random field. The random bits are preserved, the version flips between 7 (inside) and 4 (outside), and the RFC variant is kept. The mapping is injective: <code>(ts, rand) → (encTS, rand)</code>. Decode is just <code>encTS ⊕ mask</code>, so round-trip is exact.</p><p>Security: SipHash is a PRF, so observing façades doesn’t leak the key. Wrong key = wrong timestamp. Rotation can be done with a key-ID outside the UUID.</p><p>Performance: one SipHash over 10 bytes + a couple of 48-bit loads/stores. Nanosecond overhead, header-only C89, no deps, allocation-free.</p><p>Tests: SipHash reference vectors, round-trip encode/decode, and version/variant invariants.</p><p>Curious to hear feedback!</p><p><strong>EDIT1:</strong> <strong>The Postgres extension is available.</strong></p><p>It currently supports around 95% of common use cases and index types (B-trees, BRIN, etc.), but the test coverage still needs improvement and review.

The feedback I got there was super helpful — a few people pointed out I was basically forcing JSON-style dynamics into a static Protobuf world, which doesn’t really fit. That clicked with me.</p><p>Since then I hacked on a small library/plugin called <strong>Sugar-Proto</strong>. It’s a protoc plugin that generates wrappers around your <code>.proto</code> messages, giving you something closer to a <code>nlohmann/json</code> feel, but still 100% type-safe and zero runtime reflection.</p><p>Example:</p><pre><code>User user;UserWrapped u(user);u.name = &quot;Alice&quot;;u.id = 42;u.posts.push_back({{&quot;title&quot;, &quot;Hello&quot;}, {&quot;comments&quot;, {{&quot;text&quot;, &quot;Nice!&quot;}}}});</code></pre><p>Under the hood it’s just normal protobuf fields, no hidden runtime map lookups. The idea is: <strong>make the API less clunky without pretending it’s JSON.</strong></p><p>It’s early, not production-ready yet, but I’d love for people to kick the tires and tell me what feels right/wrong.</p><p>Curious to hear if anyone else tried wrapping protobuf in a more ergonomic C++ way. Do you think this direction has legs, or is protobuf doomed to always feel a bit Java-ish in C++?</p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section><section class='separator separator-before-comments'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='comments'><p>Top comments</p><ol><li><div class="md"><p>OP got nerd sniped.

With a lot of coaxing and hand-holding, you could get the tools to work. But it wasn&#39;t robust at all. Has that changed? Is it now solid on Windows?</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1nirl8a/swift_62_released/nemgd5t/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><div class="md"><p>TL;DR: give it a shot yourself.</p><p>Unfortunately, any post swift related tends to devolve into platform support ,my advice would be to try it and find out.</p><p>If you&#39;re on macOS or linux then you can use <a href="https://github.com/swiftlang/swiftly">swiftly</a>. If you&#39;re on windows then it might be worth using <a href="https://github.com/thebrowsercompany/swift-build">swift-build</a> for nightlies by The Browser Company.</p><p>It also officially supports <a href="https://github.com/swiftlang/swift/issues/78437">OpenBSD</a> and <a href="https://github.com/orgs/swiftlang/projects/16">FreeBSD</a> support is in the works(supported?) and this <a href="https://forums.swift.org/t/freebsd-mentioned-as-supported-for-swift-6-2/80378">post</a> could help guide you. With <a href="https://forums.swift.org/t/announcing-the-android-workgroup/80666">android</a> on its way.</p><p>As for LSP support, <a href="https://github.com/swiftlang/sourcekit-lsp">sourcekit</a> is just a regular old LSP so you can hook it into <a href="https://www.swift.org/documentation/articles/zero-to-swift-nvim.html">neovim</a> or any other editor that supports LSP.   </p><p>You might also find that you&#39;re editor of choice weirdly already supports it: <a href="https://release.gnome.org/45/developers/index.html">Gnome Builder</a> is a possibly exotic example and there&#39;s a fairly in-depth <a href="https://aparokshaui.github.io/adwaita-swift/tutorials/table-of-contents">tutorial</a> on building libadwaita apps with swift and publishing them onto Flatpak and such for reference to a (relatively?) decent tooling and developer setup.</p><p>On a sidenote, something I find interesting is that quite a few build systems have some sorta support for Swift outside of Swift&#39;s own package manager: <a href="https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/building_swift_projects.html">gradle</a> and <a href="https://github.com/xmake-io/xmake">xmake</a> have some arbitrary support for swift.</p><p>But, imho, the intriguing ones are <a href="https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-cmake-examples">cmake</a> with official support for swift, with a lot of the official swift libraries being built with both SPM and CMake outta the box, <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-collections">swift-collections</a> as an example.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_swift">Bazel</a> also supports swift and has build rules that allow you to ingest SPM packages(I think, don&#39;t quote me on that). Spotify has also released a <a href="https://github.com/spotify/sourcekit-bazel-bsp">bsp</a> if you so wish to use it.</p><p>Last but not least(possibly my favourite), is meson&#39;s <a href="https://mesonbuild.com/Release-notes-for-1-9-0.html#explicitly-setting-swift-module-name-is-now-supported">support</a> for swift. As of 1.9.0, it has added support for C++ interop and more. But this <a href="https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson/pull/14261">pr</a> will add support for mixed swift and c++ targets seamlessly in one target, which is something even SPM hasn&#39;t been <a href="https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-package-manager/pull/5919">able to accomplish</a>.</p><p>So, there is varying degrees of tooling but hopefully those few examples show that things are supported.</p><p>As for Windows, as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/andreicodes">u/andreicodes</a> noted. Windows support is mostly done by <a href="https://github.com/compnerd">compnerd</a> who currently works at TBC so they do most of the contributions on windows support. His github repos are a pretty good showing on what&#39;s possible.</p><p>But to emphasise how far Windows has come: there are discussions about providing <a href="https://forums.swift.org/t/question-is-swift-abi-stable-on-windows-how-far-are-we-from-there/59601/16">ABI Stability</a> onto windows (on another tangent, the swift toolchain is one of the few ABI stable toolchains outside of C which is a pretty cool technical feat) with other goodies like COM compatible classes by default etc...</p><p><a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-nio">Swift-NIO</a> is also working on getting NioPOSIX to function on windows and, at the time of writing, quite a lot of the recent commits fixing errors on the windows side.</p><p>There&#39;s also some quite compelling WinUI <a href="https://github.com/thebrowsercompany/swift-winrt">bindings</a> for swift using CMake, since there weren&#39;t any easily accessible C++ CMake repositories with good WinUI integration if you&#39;re ever in the market for that.</p><p>One downside(upside for some?) is that SPM can be a bit finnicky for larger projects on windows that might use libraries such as the winui one. There&#39;s a very long and ongoing <a href="https://forums.swift.org/t/the-state-of-winui-and-swift/79963">discussion</a> about it and the overall consensus is that CMake is preferred on windows.</p><p>There&#39;s also official support for <a href="https://github.com/swiftwasm">wasm</a> and <a href="https://www.swift.org/get-started/embedded/">embedded</a> if that tickles your fancy.</p><p>So, this is all to say, give it a try.</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1nirl8a/swift_62_released/neqhhx2/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><div class="md"><p>So sad to see such a good language behind such trash tooling...

Kinda getting sick of writing these, absolutely insane the pace of supply chain attacks anyway...<br/>The same ThreatActors behind the NX S1ngularity attack have launched a self-replicating worm, it&#39;s infected 187 packages and its terrifying.</p><p>Yesterday a software developer  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-pereira-b17a27160/">Daniel Pereira </a>noticed a weird repo being created.... when he looked into it he was the first to realize that actually <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ctrl/tinycolor">tinycolor </a>was infected with malware. He reached out to multiple people, no one took him seriously until he reached out to Socket who discovered that <a href="https://socket.dev/blog/tinycolor-supply-chain-attack-affects-40-packages">40 packages were compromised</a>.</p><p>Fun story, a little concerning but honestly this happens a lot so it&#39;s not crazy.... But then it got worse, so much worse.</p><p>When I woke up, our lead researcher Charlie Erikson had discovered that actually a total of 187 packages were compromised (147 more than Socket had reported) 20 of which were from Crowdstrike.</p><p>What does the worm do</p><ul><li><strong>Harvest</strong>: scans the host and CI environment for secrets — process.env, scanning with TruffleHog, and cloud metadata endpoints (AWS/GCP) that return instance/service credentials.</li><li><strong>Exfiltrate (1) — GitHub repo</strong>: creates a repo named <strong>Shai-Hulud</strong> under the compromised account and commits a JSON dump containing system info, environment variables, and collected secrets.</li><li><strong>Exfiltrate (2) — GitHub Actions → webhook</strong>: drops a workflow <code>.github/workflows/shai-hulud-workflow.yml</code> that serializes <code>${{ toJSON(secrets) }}</code>, POSTs them to an attacker <code>webhook[.]site</code> URL and writes a double-base64 copy into the Actions logs.</li><li><strong>Propagate</strong>: uses any valid npm tokens it finds to enumerate and attempt to update packages the compromised maintainer controls (supply-chain propagation).</li><li><strong>Amplify</strong>: iterates the victim’s accessible repositories, making them public or adding the workflow/branch that will trigger further runs and leaks.</li></ul><p>Its already turned <a href="https://github.com/search?q=Shai-Hulud+Migration&amp;ref=opensearch&amp;type=repositories&amp;s=updated&amp;o=asc">700 previously private repositories public</a>  This number will go down as they are removed by maintainers</p><p>if you remeber the S1ngularity breach this is the exact same type of attacker and 100% the same attackers.</p><p>The questions I have from that attack remain.... I have no idea why they are exfiltrating secrets to Public GitHub repos and not a private C2 servers (other than to cause chaos)</p><p>The malicious versions have since been removed by Crowdstrikes account. Here is a total list of the packages compromised and their versions</p><table><thead><tr><th>@ahmedhfarag/ngx-perfect-scrollbar</th><th>20.0.20</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>@ahmedhfarag/ngx-virtual-scroller</td><td>4.0.4</td></tr><tr><td>@art-ws/common</td><td>2.0.28</td></tr><tr><td>@art-ws/config-eslint</td><td>2.0.4,
