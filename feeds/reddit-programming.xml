It was initially called Altair BASIC before becoming Microsoft BASIC, and it was designed for the 6502 (a microprocessor used in the Apple II, Atari 2600, VIC-20, Commodore 64, and Nintendo Entertainment System).</p><p>As of yesterday, Microsoft has released the version 1.1 source code of &ldquo;Microsoft BASIC for 6502 Microprocessor&rdquo; on <a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=111346X1569483&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://github.com/microsoft/BASIC-M6502&amp;xcust=2-1-2898698-1-0-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/article/2898698/microsofts-first-ever-programming-language-was-just-open-sourced.html">GitHub</a>, which means you can freely view the assembly code and even download it if you want to.</p><p>Why did Microsoft publish this code? Because it has historical significance and was one of the pillars of modern software:</p><blockquote><p>This source code represents the foundation upon which the modern software industry was built. The techniques, patterns, and business models pioneered in this BASIC interpreter directly influenced:</p><ul> <li>The development of MS-DOS and subsequent Microsoft operating systems</li> <li>The standardization of programming language implementations</li> <li>The establishment of software licensing as a business model</li> <li>The democratization of computer programming</li> </ul> </blockquote><p>Microsoft&rsquo;s version of BASIC was one of the first programming languages that the general public came into contact with, making it an important milestone in computer history. While Microsoft BASIC is no longer used in earnest, its spirit lives on with Visual Basic .NET.</p></body></div><p>This article originally appeared on our sister publication <a href="https://www.pcforalla.se">PC f&ouml;r Alla</a> and was translated and localized from Swedish.</p><div><h3> <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/author/mikael_markander"> Author: Mikael Markander</a>, Contributor, PCWorld </h3><div><p>Mikael writes news across all our consumer tech categories.

A while ago I gave a tongue-in-cheek talk on the topic, so ahead of the meet-up one of the organizers asked what principles I would replace SOLID with since I disagreed with them. I have been thinking about this for some time and I proposed five of my own, which form the acronym <em>CUPID</em>.</p><p>This article isn&rsquo;t about those principles, that will be my next post. This is about why I think we need them. I want to share the back story and explain why I&rsquo;ve never really bought into SOLID. To do that, let&rsquo;s talk about the talk.</p><h2>Why every single element of SOLID is wrong<a href="https://dannorth.net#why-every-single-element-of-solid-is-wrong"></a> </h2><p><a href="https://pubconf.io">PubConf</a> was invented as a kind of afterparty to the NDC conferences. As the name suggests, it takes place in a pub. Several speakers give an Ignite-style talk - 20 slides, 15 seconds per slide, auto-advancing - and the audience roars, stamps, claps and thunders its approval accordingly. The winner gets something and everyone has a great time.</p><p>A few years ago I was invited to speak at a PubConf event in London. I like the challenge of a constrained talk. This one had to be drunk-people funny and Ignite-shaped. I had been thinking about Robert C. Martin&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.baeldung.com/solid-principles">SOLID principles</a>, and in the spirit of &ldquo;it depends&rdquo; I thought it would be fun to see whether I could refute each principle with a straight face. I also wanted to propose an alternative in each case.</p><p>Now some talks write themselves: I figured I could use one slide to introduce each principle, one to challenge it, one to pitch an alternative, five times. That&rsquo;s 15 slides, with 45 seconds per principle. Top-and-tail it, and there were my 20 slides!</p><p>As I wrote the talk I noticed two things. First, it was much easier to refute each principle than I thought (apart from Liskov&rsquo;s Substitution Principle, so I had to tackle that a different way). Second, the alternative kept turning out to be the same thing: <em>Write simple code</em>. It is easy to challenge that with &ldquo;What does &lsquo;simple&rsquo; even mean?&rdquo; but I had a good working definition for that so I wasn&rsquo;t too worried.</p><p>After the conference I put <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/tastapod/why-every-element-of-solid-is-wrong">the slides up on SpeakerDeck</a> and a whole load of people I have never met started attacking first the premise of the talk, then the detail of slides from a talk they never heard me give, then <a href="https://www.entropywins.wtf/blog/2017/02/17/why-every-single-argument-of-dan-north-is-wrong/">me personally</a>.</p><p>Since I&rsquo;ve never written it up, here is roughly how the talk went. Bear in mind that for each principle, I had 15 seconds to introduce it, 15 seconds to challenge it, and 15 seconds to propose an alternative. Ready? Go!</p><h3>Single Responsibility Principle<a href="https://dannorth.net#single-responsibility-principle"><svg><path></path></svg></a> </h3><p>The Single Responsibility Principle says that code should only do one thing. Another framing is that it should have &ldquo;one reason to change&rdquo;. I called this the &ldquo;Pointlessly Vague Principle&rdquo;. What is one thing anyway? Is ETL - Extract-Transform-Load - one thing (a <code>DataProcessor</code>) or three things? Any non-trivial code can have any number of reasons to change, which may or may not include the one you had in mind, so again this doesn&rsquo;t make much sense to me.</p><p>Instead I suggested to <em>write simple code</em> using the heuristic that it &ldquo;Fits In My Head&rdquo;. What does that mean? You can only reason about something if it fits in your head. Conversely, if something doesn&rsquo;t fit in your head, you can&rsquo;t reason about it. Code should fit in your head at any level of granularity, whether it is at method/function level, class/module level, components made up of classes, or entire distributed applications.</p><p>You might ask &lsquo;Whose head?&rsquo; For the purpose of the heuristic I assume the owner of the head can read and write idiomatic code in whichever languages are in play, and that they are familiar with the problem domain. If they need more esoteric knowledge than that, for instance knowing which of the many undocumented internal systems we need to integrate with to get any work done, then that should be made explicit in the code so that it will fit in their head.</p><p>At each scale there should be enough conceptual integrity that you can grasp &ldquo;the whole&rdquo; at that level. If you can&rsquo;t, then that is a heuristic to strive for in your restructuring activities. Sometimes you can bundle several things together and they still fit in your head. The bundling even makes them easier to reason about than if they are artificially split out because someone insisted on Single Responsibility. In other cases, it makes sense to decompose a single responsibility artificially into several steps just to make each one easier to reason about.</p><h3>Open-Closed Principle<a href="https://dannorth.net#open-closed-principle"></a> </h3><p>This is the idea that code should be <em>open for extension</em>, i.e. easy to extend without changing, and <em>closed for modification</em>, i.e. you can trust what it does so you don&rsquo;t need to go in and tinker with it.</p><p>This was sage advice in an age where code was:</p><ul> <li><strong>expensive to change:</strong> Try making a small change and then compiling and linking a few million lines of C++ in the 1990s. I&rsquo;ll wait.</li> <li><strong>risky to change</strong>, because we hadn&rsquo;t figured out <a href="https://www.refactoring.com">refactoring</a> yet, never mind <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com">refactoring IDEs</a> (outside of Smalltalk) or <a href="https://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/TestDrivenDevelopment.html">example-guided programming</a>.</li> <li><strong>mostly additive:</strong> You would write some code, check it in (if you were down with the kids and using a version control system like RCS or SCCS), and then move on to the next file. You were translating the detailed functional spec into code, one lump at a time. Renaming things was uncommon; renaming files doubly so. CVS, which became the ubiquitous source control system, would <em>literally forget the entire history of a file</em> if you renamed it, it was such an uncommon activity. This is easy to overlook in an age of automated refactoring, and changeset-based version control.</li> </ul><p>Nowadays, the equivalent advice if you need code to do something else is: <em>Change the code to make it do something else!</em> It sounds trite, but we think of code as malleable now <a href="https://www.artima.com/articles/working-the-program">like clay</a>, where in the Olden Days the metaphor was more like building blocks. There was no feedback loop between The Spec and The Code like we have with automated examples.</p><p>In this case I railed against the &lsquo;Cruft Accretion Principle". Code is not an &ldquo;asset&rdquo; to be carefully shrink-wrapped and preserved, but a cost, a debt. <em>All code is cost.</em> So if I can take a big pile of existing cost and replace it with a smaller more specific cost, then I&rsquo;m winning at code! <em>Write simple code</em> that is easy to change, and you have code that is both open and closed, however you need it.</p><h3>Liskov Substitution Principle<a href="https://dannorth.net#liskov-substitution-principle"><svg><path></path></svg></a> </h3><p>This is just the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment">Principle of Least Surprise</a> applied to code substitution, and as such is pretty sensible. If I tell you something is a valid subtype of the thing you have, then you should be able to assume it will act the same in any sense that you care about.</p><p>However, the language LSP uses of &ldquo;subtypes&rsquo;, coupled with the way most developers conflate subtypes with subclasses, and the vagaries of &ldquo;desirable properties&rsquo;, means that it tends to evoke the class-based inheritance language of &ldquo;<em>is-a</em>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<em>has-a</em>&rdquo;, and its corresponding 1980s entity modelling.</p><p>In the spirit of using a butter knife as a screwdriver, many objects can &ldquo;<em>act-like-a</em>&rdquo; or &ldquo;<em>sometimes-be-used-as-a</em>&rdquo; or &ldquo;<em>pass-off-as-a-if-you-squint</em>&rdquo;. In this context what we really want is small, simple types that we can compose into whatever more complex structures we need, and to make our peace with all the nuances that go along with that. My advice, <em>quelle surprise</em>, is to &ldquo;write simple code&rdquo; that is easy to reason about.</p><h3>Interface Segregation Principle<a href="https://dannorth.net#interface-segregation-principle"></a> </h3><p>This really is fish-in-a-barrel as principles go. For some reason, this one caused the most controversy, but to me it is the easiest to debunk. While <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_segregation_principle">researching</a> this talk I discovered that this pattern came about when Robert C. Martin was wrangling a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_object">God object</a> in the middle of some printing software at Xerox. Everything was happening in a class called <code>Job</code>. His approach to simplifying it was to find each place where it was used, figure out which methods &ldquo;went together&rdquo; and put those in an intermediate interface. This had several immediate benefits:</p><ul> <li>Collecting related methods into different interfaces showed all the different responsibilities the <code>Job</code> class was performing.</li> <li>Giving each interface an intention-revealing name made the code easier to reason about than just passing a <code>Job</code> object around.</li> <li>It created the option to break the <code>Job</code> class out into smaller classes fronted by each interface. (Arguably they didn&rsquo;t need the interface any more now.)</li> </ul><p>All of this makes sense, it&rsquo;s just that it isn&rsquo;t a principle, it is a pattern. A principle is something that is generally good advice in any context: Seek first to understand, then to be understood; Be excellent to each other.</p><p>A pattern is a strategy that works in a given context (God class) that has benefits (smaller components) and trade-offs (more separate things to manage). The principle would have been about not getting into that mess in the first place!</p><p>Thus I argued that if this were a principle at all, it was the &ldquo;Stable Door Principle&rdquo;. If you had small, role-based classes in the first place, you wouldn&rsquo;t be in the position of trying to decompose a huge, tangled mess.</p><p>Sure, we may find ourselves in that context from time to time, and when we do, interface segregation is a perfectly cromulent strategy for slicing your way towards sanity, along with building a suite of <a href="https://michaelfeathers.silvrback.com/characterization-testing">characterization tests</a> and all of the other advice in Mike Feathers&rsquo; brilliant <a href="https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/program/Feathers-Working-Effectively-with-Legacy-Code/PGM254740.html">Working Effectively With Legacy Code</a>.</p><h3>Dependency Inversion Principle<a href="https://dannorth.net#dependency-inversion-principle"><svg><path></path></svg></a> </h3><p>While there is nothing fundamentally wrong with DIP, I don&rsquo;t think it is an overstatement to say that our obsession with dependency inversion has single-handedly caused billions of dollars in irretrievable sunk cost and waste over the last couple of decades.</p><p>The real principle here is <em>option</em> inversion. A dependency is only interesting when there might be multiple ways of providing it, and you only need to invert the relationship when you believe the wiring is important enough to become a separate concern. That&rsquo;s quite a high bar, and mostly all you ever need is a <code>main</code> method.</p><p>If instead you subscribe to the idea that all dependencies should be inverted all the time, you end up with J2EE, OSGi, Spring, or any other &ldquo;declarative assembly&rdquo; framework where the structuring of the components is itself a twisty maze of config. J2EE deserves a special mention for deciding that each type of dependency inversion - EJBs, servlets, web domains, remote service location, even the configuration configuration - should be owned by different roles.</p><p>In the wild, there are entire shadow codebases where each class is backed by exactly one interface, which only exists to satisfy a wiring framework or to inject a mock or stub for automated testing theatre. The promise of &ldquo;you can just swap out the database&rdquo; evaporates as soon as you try to, well, swap out the database.</p><p>Most dependencies don&rsquo;t need inverting, because most dependencies aren&rsquo;t options, they are just the way we are going to do it this time. So my - by now entirely unsurprising - suggestion is to <em>write simple code</em>, by focusing on use rather than reuse.</p><h2>&lsquo;If you don&rsquo;t like them, I have others&rsquo;<a href="https://dannorth.net#if-you-dont-like-them-i-have-others"></a> </h2><p>When I look at SOLID, I see a mix of things that were once good advice, patterns that apply in a context, and advice that is easy to misapply. I wouldn&rsquo;t offer any of it as context-free advice to new programmers. So what would I do instead? I thought there might be a one-to-one correspondence for each of the SOLID principles and patterns, since there is nothing inherently bad or wrong with any of them, but as the saying goes, &lsquo;If I were going to Dublin, I wouldn&rsquo;t start from here.&rsquo;</p><p>So, given what I have learned about software development over the last 30 years, are there any principles that I would offer instead? And could they form a pithy acronym? The answer is in yes, and I will outline them in the next article.</p><p>Check out <a href="https://goalwards.co">Goalwards</a><sup>&reg;</sup>, our new business agility practice! </p><section> <hyvor-talk-comments></hyvor-talk-comments> </section> </div></section>]]></description><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2025 22:23:43 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.bitflux.ai/blog/memory-is-slow-part2/</link><title>io_uring is faster than mmap (bitflux.ai)</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1n9ahja/io_uring_is_faster_than_mmap/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1n9ahja/io_uring_is_faster_than_mmap/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p>Reading time: 41 min | <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1n9ahja/io_uring_is_faster_than_mmap/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='separator separator-before-parsed-content'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='parsed-content'><section> <h2>TL;DR</h2><p>Sourcing data directly from disk <em>IS</em> faster than caching in memory. I brought receipts. Because hardware got wider but not faster, the old methods don't get you there. You need new tools to use what is scaling and avoid what isn't.</p><h2>Introduction</h2><p>In part 1 I showed how some computer performance factors are scaling exponentially while others have been stagnant for decades. I then asserted, without proof, that sourcing data from disk can be faster than from memory. What follows is the proof.</p><p>Computer Science dogma says that unused memory should be used to cache things from the filesystem because the disk is slow and memory is fast. Given that disk bandwidth is growing exponentially and memory access latency has stagnated this isn't always true anymore.</p><h2>Experimental set up</h2><p>We need data and something straight forward to do with the data. I used my free will or the illusion thereof to create a benchmark I cleverly call "counting 10s". I write some pseudo random integers between 0 and 20 to a buffer and then count how many of the integers are 10. I want to make sure we are doing all the counting in a single thread to simulate an Amdahl's Law situation.</p><p>So how fast can we expect this to run? The upper limit would be the memory bandwidth.</p><p>My testing rig is a server with an old AMD EPYC 7551P 32-Core Processor on a Supermicro H11SSL-i and 96GB of DDR4 2133 MHz and a couple of 1.92TB Samsung PM983a PCIe 3.0 SSDs I pieced together from EBay parts. Given the way this server is configured, the upper limit for memory bandwidth can be calculated as 3 channels * 2133MT/s * 8B/T / 4 numa domains = ~13GB/s for a single thread.

There must be some other bottleneck.</p><h2>Can the SSDs beat that?</h2><p>5.51GB/s? On paper the SSDs can read at 6.2GB/s, but the first run from disk only did 0.61GB/s. How can I meet or beat this performance sourcing the data directly from disk?</p><p>Consider how the default mmap() mechanism works, it is a background IO pipeline to transparently fetch the data from disk. When you read the empty buffer from userspace it triggers a fault, the kernel handles the fault by reading the data from the filesystem, which then queues up IO from disk. Unfortunately these legacy mechanisms just aren't set up for serious high performance IO. Note that at 610MB/s it's faster than what a disk SATA can do. On the other hand, it only managed 10% of our disk's potential. Clearly we're going to have to do something else.</p><p>SSDs don't just automatically read data at multigigabyte speeds. You need to put some real effort into an IO pipeline to get serious performance.</p><p>I made a io_uring based IO engine, a kind of userspace driver, that can hit these speeds. The main thread will request data, the IO engine will handle the IO, then the main thread will do the counting when the data is in a buffer. We will use a set of queues to manage the IO requests, responses, and buffers. The IO engine will start 6 workers, target a queue depth of 8192, and have a buffer size of 16KB.</p><p>I wish I had tighter code here, but A) I didn&rsquo;t have time to clean it up B) some of the complexity is intractable.

That's 2.75 seconds out of 9 seconds that was spent waiting on the caching system instead of counting. Why so much?</p><p><strong>mmap()</strong></p><p>The mmap() call presents the process with a buffer that is a blank slate even when the data is already in memory. The buffer is populated page by page as it's accessed from the page cache. This isn't a copy, it's just the operating system mapping the cached memory into the process. This costs more than it might seem. The worst case with mmap() the counting has to pause at every 4KB page boundary while the kernel processes a fault, tracks down the page of data in the page cache, then updates the page table of the process to insert the memory into the process. Fundamentally this is a process that is limited by the memory latency, not the CPU speed or memory bandwidth. With the potential for TLB walks and searching lists that track the page cache, we&rsquo;re taking potentially dozens of CPU cache misses and several microseconds of waiting on memory for every 4KB page.</p><p><strong>direct IO</strong></p><p>Using our direct from disk approach uses pipelines and streams which avoids the kind of memory latency dominated bottleneck that mmap() has. In our case we're limited by the bandwidth of our disks yet because of the pipelining, the larger latency of the IOs doesn't get in the critical path of the counting very much. Allowing for higher throughput.</p><h2>Scaling</h2><p>Consider the implications of these experiments as we scale. The well vetted solution to get data from memory to a process is slower than using the disk directly. This isn't because the memory is slower than the disk. The memory has higher bandwidth than the disk, not by an order of magnitude, but a decent margin. But the latency of the memory is orders of magnitude lower than the disk. Nevertheless the <em>way</em> the data in memory is accessed is the culprit. Its a synchronous approach that assumes memory operations are cheap and low latency. These accesses add up and it ends up waiting on memory latencies. The disk method on the other hand is as a streaming approach built to leverage bandwidth and hide latencies.</p><p><strong>extending the existing rig</strong></p><p>If I got a few more of these disks I could push the IO bandwidth to be greater than the 13GB/s per thread memory bandwidth limit. IO is DMA'ed to buffers that are pretty small compared to the total dataset. These buffers scale with the throughput capabilities of the CPU and the disks, not the dataset size. The buffers can be located in a single numa domain allowing us to avoid the overhead of accessing the buffers between NUMA domains. Add more disks to this system I might be able to create a disk based solution to count at the full 13GB/s rather than be limited to the 7.90GB/s we see with the in memory example at the full 50GB dataset. With such a system our throughput would not be affected by the dataset size, unlike the in-memory case, which has numa overhead and eventually runs out of memory to scale.</p><p><strong>faster than memory is possible</strong></p><p>On a proper modern server the CPUs will let you do IO directly to the L3 cache, bypassing memory altogether. Because PCIe bandwidth is higher than memory bandwidth, on paper we could even get more max bandwidth than we can get from memory if we carefully pin the buffers into the CPU cache. I haven't confirm this works in practice, however, it could be made to work and is the sort of thing that CPU designs will be forced to lean into to push performance forward.</p><p><strong>memory is changing too</strong></p><p>This isn't just about disks vs memory. Similar techniques and principles apply to memory. Memory bandwidth is still scaling even if the latency is not. This means to take advantage of memory performance you have to actually treat it more like a disk and less like Random Access Memory. To scale performance with generational updates you have to make sure to stream data from memory into the CPU caches in blocks, similar to how data is streamed from disk to memory. If not you end up with 90s level memory throughput. A custom mechanism to cache data in memory could easily avoid the memory latency problems seen with the default mmap() solution with much less code than the io_uring solution.</p><h2>Is this worth it?</h2><p>I'm not going to say that going to the effort of implementing something like this is always worth it. The mmap() method is sure elegant from a coding perspective, especially when compared to all the code I had to write to get the io_uring setup working. Sometimes the simple way is the way to go.</p><p>Is using 6 cores of IO for 1 core of compute is always the right answer? Probably not. This was an extreme situation to prove a point. In realworld situations you'll need to look at the tradeoffs and decide what's best for your use case. Correctly understanding the strengths and weaknesses of the hardware can open up a number of possibilities where you can get a lot more performance for a lot less money.</p><p>The kind of overhead demonstrated with mmap() isn&rsquo;t going to go away, new hardware isn't going to fix it. At the same time disk bandwidth and the number of cores are scaling each generation. But doing things that scale performance with new technology is going to take extra code and effort.</p><p>But don't just blow this stuff off. Sure you <em>can</em> dedicate a server with 3TB of memory to serve 10K client connections. Memory in the cloud is like ~$5/GB/month, if you can afford it, then you do you. However it is worth considering that humanity doesn't have the silicon fabs or the power plants to support this for every moron vibe coder out there making an app. I figure either the karmic debt to the planet, or a vengeful AI demigod hungry for silicon and electricity will come for those that don't heed this warning, eventually. Either way my conscience is clear.</p><h2>Recap</h2> <ul> <li>Memory is slow - when you use it oldschool.</li> <li>Disk is fast - when you are clever with it.</li> <li>Test the dogma - compounded exponentials are flipping somethings from true to false.</li> </ul><p><strong>Bad news</strong> is that this cleverness requires extra code and effort.</p><p><strong>Good news</strong> is we now have AI to write and test the extra code this cleverness requires.</p><p><strong>Better news</strong> is that, for those that are willing to learn, AI's don't do this unless you know how to ask them.</p><p>Lean into things that scale, avoid things that don&rsquo;t.</p><h2>Next Time</h2><p>What will be revealed in the next episode?</p><ul> <li>Is O(&radic;n) actually faster than O(log n)?

All of the problems I want to talk about today exist inside of Google&rsquo;s codebase; it&rsquo;s not just a matter of &ldquo;using protobuffers wrong&rdquo; or some such nonsense like that.</p><p>By far, the biggest problem with protobuffers is their terrible type-system. Fans of Java should feel right at home with protobuffers, but unfortunately, literally nobody considers Java to have a well-designed type-system. The dynamic typing guys complain about it being too stifling, while the static typing guys like me complain about it being too stifling without giving you any of the things you actually want in a type-system. Lose lose.</p><p>The ad-hoc-ness and the built-by-amateurs-itude go hand-in-hand. So much of the protobuffer spec feels bolted on as an afterthought that it clearly <em>was</em> bolted on as an afterthought. Many of its restrictions will make you stop, scratch your head and ask &ldquo;wat?&rdquo; But these are just symptoms of the deeper answer, which is this:</p><p>Protobuffers were obviously built by amateurs because they offer <em>bad solutions to widely-known and already-solved problems.</em></p><h3>No Compositionality</h3><p>Protobuffers offer several &ldquo;features&rdquo;, but none of them see to work with one another. For example, look at the list of orthogonal-yet-constrained typing features that I found by skimming the <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3">documentation</a>.</p><ul> <li><code>oneof</code> fields can&rsquo;t be <code>repeated</code>.</li> <li><code>map<k></k></code> fields have dedicated syntax for their keys and values, but this isn&rsquo;t used for any other types.</li> <li>Despite <code>map</code> fields being able to be parameterized, no user-defined types can be. This means you&rsquo;ll be stuck hand-rolling your own specializations of common data structures.</li> <li><code>map</code> fields cannot be <code>repeated</code>.</li> <li><code>map</code> keys <em>can</em> be <code>string</code>s, but <em>can not</em> be <code>bytes</code>. They also can&rsquo;t be <code>enum</code>s, even though <code>enum</code>s are considered to be equivalent to integers everywhere else in the protobuffer spec.</li> <li><code>map</code> values cannot be other <code>map</code>s.</li> </ul><p>This insane list of restrictions is the result of unprincipled design choices and bolting on features after the fact. For example, <code>oneof</code> fields can&rsquo;t be <code>repeated</code> because rather than resulting in a coproduct type, instead the code generator will give you a product of mutually-exclusive optional fields. Such a transformation is only valid for a singular field (and, as we&rsquo;ll see later, not even then.)</p><p>The restriction behind <code>map</code> fields being unable to be <code>repeated</code> is related, but shows off a different limitation of the type-system. Behind the scenes, a <code>map<k></k></code> is desugared into something spiritually similar to <code>repeated Pair<k></k></code>. And because <code>repeated</code> is a magical language keyword rather than a type in its own right, it doesn&rsquo;t compose with itself.</p><p>Your guess is as good as mine for why an <code>enum</code> can&rsquo;t be used as a <code>map</code> key.</p><p>What&rsquo;s so frustrating about all of this is a little understanding of how modern type-systems work would be enough to <em>drastically simplify</em> the protobuffer spec and simultaneously <em>remove all of the arbitrary restrictions.</em></p><p>The solution is as follows:</p><ul> <li>Make all fields in a message <code>required</code>. This makes messages <em>product types</em>.</li> <li>Promote <code>oneof</code> fields to instead be standalone data types. These are <em>coproduct types</em>.</li> <li>Give the ability to parameterize product and coproduct types by other types.</li> </ul><p>That&rsquo;s it! These three features are all you need in order to define any possible piece of data. With these simpler pieces, we can re-implement the rest of the protobuffer spec in terms of them.</p><p>For example, we can rebuild <code>optional</code> fields:</p><div><pre><code><span>product Unit <span>{</span></span> <span> <span>// no fields</span></span> <span><span>}</span></span> <span>coproduct Optional<span>&lt;</span>t<span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span></span> <span> t value <span>=</span> <span>;</span></span> <span> Unit unset <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span></span> <span><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Building <code>repeated</code> fields is simple too:</p><div><pre><code><span>coproduct List<span>&lt;</span>t<span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span></span> <span> Unit empty <span>=</span> <span>;</span></span> <span> Pair<span>&lt;</span>t<span>,</span> List<span>&lt;</span>t<span>&gt;&gt;</span> cons <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span></span> <span><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Of course, the actual serialization logic is allowed to do something smarter than pushing linked-lists across the network&mdash;after all, <a href="https://reasonablypolymorphic.com/blog/follow-the-denotation/">implementations and semantics don&rsquo;t need to align one-to-one</a>.</p><h3>Questionable Choices</h3><p>In the vein of Java, protobuffers make the distinction between <em>scalar</em> types and <em>message</em> types. Scalars correspond more-or-less to machine primitives&mdash;things like <code>int32</code>, <code>bool</code> and <code>string</code>. Messages, on the other hand, are everything else. All library- and user-defined types are messages.</p><p>The two varieties of types have completely different semantics, of course.</p><p>Fields with scalar types are always present. Even if you don&rsquo;t set them. Did I mention that (at least in proto3<a href="https://reasonablypolymorphic.com#fn1"><sup>1</sup></a>) all protobuffers can be zero-initialized with absolutely no data in them? Scalar fields get false-y values&mdash;<code>uint32</code> is initialized to <code>0</code> for example, and <code>string</code> is initialized as <code>""</code>.</p><p>It&rsquo;s impossible to differentiate a field that was missing in a protobuffer from one that was assigned to the default value. Presumably this decision is in place in order to allow for an optimization of not needing to send default scalar values over the wire. Presumably, though the <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/encoding">encoding guide</a> makes no mention of this optimization being performed, so your guess is as good as mine.</p><p>As we&rsquo;ll see when we discuss protobuffers&rsquo; claim to being god&rsquo;s gift to backwards- and forwards-compatible APIs, this inability to distinguish between unset and default values is a nightmare. Especially if indeed it&rsquo;s a design decision made in order to save one bit (set or not) per field.</p><p>Contrast this behavior against message types. While scalar fields are dumb, the behavior for message fields is outright <em>insane.</em> Internally, message fields are either there or they&rsquo;re not&mdash;but their behavior is crazy. Some pseudocode for their accessor is worth a thousand words. Pretend this is Java or something similar:</p><div><pre><code><span><span>private</span> Foo m_foo<span>;</span></span> <span><span>public</span> Foo foo <span>{</span></span> <span> <span>// only if `foo` is used as an expression</span></span> <span> get <span>{</span></span> <span> <span>if</span> <span>(</span>m_foo <span>!=</span> <span>null</span><span>)</span></span> <span> <span>return</span> m_foo<span>;</span></span> <span> <span>else</span></span> <span> <span>return</span> <span>new</span> <span>Foo</span><span>();</span></span> <span> <span>}</span></span> <span> <span>// instead if `foo` is used as an lvalue</span></span> <span> mutable get <span>{</span></span> <span> <span>if</span> <span>(</span>m_foo <span>=</span> <span>null</span><span>)</span></span> <span> m_foo <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Foo</span><span>();</span></span> <span> <span>return</span> m_foo<span>;</span></span> <span> <span>}</span></span> <span><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The idea is that if the <code>foo</code> field is unset, you&rsquo;ll see a default-initialized copy whenever you ask for it, but won&rsquo;t actually modify its container. But if you modify <code>foo</code>, it will modify its parent as well! All of this just to avoid using a <code>Maybe Foo</code> type and the associated &ldquo;headaches&rdquo; of the nuance behind needing to figure out what an unset value should mean.</p><p>This behavior is especially egregious, because it breaks a law! We&rsquo;d expect the assignment <code>msg.foo = msg.foo;</code> to be a no-op. Instead the implementation will actually silently change <code>msg</code> to have a zero-initialized copy of <code>foo</code> if it previously didn&rsquo;t have one.</p><p>Unlike scalar fields, at least it&rsquo;s possible to detect if a message field is unset. Language bindings for protobuffers offer something along the lines of a generated <code>bool has_foo()</code> method. In the frequent case of copying a message field from one proto to another, iff it was present, you&rsquo;ll need to write the following code:</p><div><pre><code><span><span>if</span> <span>(</span>src<span>.</span>has_foo<span>(</span>src<span>))</span> <span>{</span></span> <span> dst<span>.</span>set_foo<span>(</span>src<span>.</span>foo<span>());</span></span> <span><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Notice that, at least in statically-typed languages, this pattern <em>cannot be abstracted</em> due to the nominal relationship between the methods <code>foo()</code>, <code>set_foo()</code> and <code>has_foo()</code>. Because all of these functions are their own <em>identifiers</em>, we have no means of programmatically generating them, save for a preprocessor macro:</p><div><pre><code><span><span>#define COPY_IFF_SET</span><span>(</span>src<span>,</span>dst<span>,</span>field<span>)</span><span>\</span></span> <span><span>if</span><span>(</span>src<span>.</span><span>has_</span><span>##</span>field<span>(</span>src<span>))</span><span>{</span><span>\</span></span> <span>dst<span>.</span><span>set_</span><span>##</span>field<span>(</span>src<span>.</span>field<span>());</span><span>\</span></span> <span><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div><p>(but preprocessor macros are verboten by the <a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Preprocessor_Macros">Google style guide</a>.)</p><p>If instead all optional fields were implemented as <code>Maybe</code>s, you&rsquo;d get abstract-able, referentially transparent call-sites for free.</p><p>To change tack, let&rsquo;s talk about another questionable decision. While you can define <code>oneof</code> fields in protobuffers, their semantics are <em>not</em> of coproduct types! Rookie mistake my dudes! What you get instead is an optional field for each case of the <code>oneof</code>, and magic code in the setters that will just unset any other case if this one is set.</p><p>At first glance, this seems like it should be semantically equivalent to having a proper union type. But instead it is an accursed, unutterable source of bugs! When this behavior teams up with the law-breaking implementation of <code>msg.foo = msg.foo;</code>, it allows this benign-looking assignment to silently delete arbitrary amounts of data!</p><p>What this means at the end of the day is that <code>oneof</code> fields do not form law-abiding <code>Prism</code>s, nor do messages form law-abiding <code>Lens</code>es. Which is to say good luck trying to write bug-free, non-trivial manipulations of protobuffers. It is <em>literally impossible to write generic, bug-free, polymorphic code over protobuffers.</em></p><p>That&rsquo;s not the sort of thing anybody likes to hear, let alone those of us who have grown to love parametric polymorphism&mdash;which gives us the <em>exact opposite promise.</em></p><h2>The Lie of Backwards- and Forwards-Compatibility</h2><p>One of the frequently cited killer features of protobuffers is their &ldquo;hassle-free ability to write backwards- and forwards-compatible APIs.&rdquo; This is the claim that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.</p><p>What protobuffers are is <em>permissive.</em> They manage to not shit the bed when receiving messages from the past or from the future because they make absolutely no promises about what your data will look like. Everything is optional! But if you need it anyway, protobuffers will happily cook up and serve you something that typechecks, regardless of whether or not it&rsquo;s meaningful.</p><p>This means that protobuffers achieve their promised time-traveling compatibility guarantees by <em>silently doing the wrong thing by default.</em> Of course, the cautious programmer can (and should) write code that performs sanity checks on received protobuffers. But if at every use-site you need to write defensive checks ensuring your data is sane, maybe that just means your deserialization step was too permissive. All you&rsquo;ve managed to do is decentralize sanity-checking logic from a well-defined boundary and push the responsibility of doing it throughout your entire codebase.</p><p>One possible argument here is that protobuffers will hold onto any information present in a message that they don&rsquo;t understand. In principle this means that it&rsquo;s nondestructive to route a message through an intermediary that doesn&rsquo;t understand this version of its schema. Surely that&rsquo;s a win, isn&rsquo;t it?</p><p>Granted, on paper it&rsquo;s a cool feature. But I&rsquo;ve never once seen an application that will actually preserve that property. With the one exception of routing software, nothing wants to inspect only some bits of a message and then forward it on unchanged. The vast majority of programs that operate on protobuffers will decode one, transform it into another, and send it somewhere else. Alas, these transformations are bespoke and coded by hand. And hand-coded transformations from one protobuffer to another don&rsquo;t preserve unknown fields between the two, because it&rsquo;s literally meaningless.</p><p>This pervasive attitude towards protobuffers always being compatible rears its head in other ugly ways. Style guides for protobuffers actively advocate against DRY and suggest inlining definitions whenever possible. The reasoning behind this is that it allows you to evolve messages separately if these definitions diverge in the future. To emphasize that point, the suggestion is to fly in the face of 60 years&rsquo; worth of good programming practice just in case <em>maybe</em> one day in the future you need to change something.</p><p>At the root of the problem is that Google conflates the meaning of data with its physical representation. When you&rsquo;re at Google scale, this sort of thing probably makes sense. After all, they have an internal tool that allows you to compare the finances behind programmer hours vs network utilization vs the cost to store <span>\(x\)</span> bytes vs all sorts of other things. Unlike most companies in the tech space, paying engineers is one of Google&rsquo;s smallest expenses. Financially it makes sense for them to waste programmers&rsquo; time in order to shave off a few bytes.</p><p>Outside of the top five tech companies, none of us is within five orders of magnitude of being Google scale. Your startup <em>cannot afford</em> to waste engineer hours on shaving off bytes. But shaving off bytes and wasting programmers&rsquo; time in the process is exactly what protobuffers are optimized for.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s face it. You are not Google scale and you never will be. Stop cargo-culting technology just because &ldquo;Google uses it&rdquo; and therefore &ldquo;it&rsquo;s an industry best-practice.&rdquo;</p><h2>Protobuffers Contaminate Codebases</h2><p>If it were possible to restrict protobuffer usage to network-boundaries I wouldn&rsquo;t be nearly as hard on it as a technology. Unfortunately, while there are a few solutions in principle, none of them is good enough to actually be used in real software.</p><p>Protobuffers correspond to the data you want to send over the wire, which is often <em>related</em> but not <em>identical</em> to the actual data the application would like to work with. This puts us in the uncomfortable position of needing to choose between one of three bad alternatives:</p><ol> <li>Maintain a separate type that describes the data you actually want, and ensure that the two evolve simultaneously.</li> <li>Pack rich data into the wire format for application use.</li> <li>Derive rich information every time you need it from a terse wire format.</li> </ol><p>Option 1 is clearly the &ldquo;right&rdquo; solution, but its untenable with protobuffers. The language isn&rsquo;t powerful enough to encode types that can perform double-duty as both wire and application formats. Which means you&rsquo;d need to write a completely separate datatype, evolve it synchronously with the protobuffer, and <em>explicitly write serialization code between the two.</em> Seeing as most people seem to use protobuffers in order to not write serialization code, this is obviously never going to happen.</p><p>Instead, code that uses protobuffers allows them to proliferate throughout the codebase. True story, my main project at Google was a compiler that took &ldquo;programs&rdquo; written in one variety of protobuffer, and spit out an equivalent &ldquo;program&rdquo; in another. Both the input and output formats were expressive enough that maintaining proper parallel C++ versions of them could never possibly work. As a result, my code was unable to take advantage of any of the rich techniques we&rsquo;ve discovered for writing compilers, because protobuffer data (and resulting code-gen) is simply too rigid to do anything interesting.</p><p>The result is that a thing that could have been 50 lines of <a href="https://github.com/passy/awesome-recursion-schemes">recursion schemes</a> was instead 10,000 lines of ad-hoc buffer-shuffling. The code I wanted to write was literally impossible when constrained by having protobuffers in the mix.</p><p>While this is an anecdote, it&rsquo;s not in isolation. By virtue of their rigid code-generation, manifestations of protobuffers in languages are never idiomatic, nor can they be made to be&mdash;short of rewriting the code-generator.</p><p>But even then, you still have the problem of needing to embed a shitty type-system into the targeted language. Because most of protobuffers&rsquo; features are ill-conceived, these unsavory properties leak into our codebases. It means we&rsquo;re forced to not only implement, but also use these bad ideas in any project which hopes to interface with protobuffers.</p><p>While it&rsquo;s easy to implement inane things out of a solid foundation, going the other direction is challenging at best and the dark path of Eldrich madness at worst.</p><p>In short, abandon all hope ye who introduce protobuffers into your projects.</p><section> <hr> <ol> <li><p>To this day, there&rsquo;s a raging debate inside Google itself about proto2 and whether fields should ever be marked as <code>required</code>.

Differences between language versions, as well as some unusual OS version differences, resulted in a few days of unproductive debugging of your development environment. I've had similar excitement when I started my first Docker Swarm (who uses that these days?!) - it felt revolutionary. Docker wasn't just a tool - it fundamentally changed how we thought about application development and deployment. Having a repeatable, separated environment from your local system was refreshing and looked like a superpower. It has become a must-have tool for every engineer. "<em>Just Dockerize it</em>" became my go-to solution for pretty much everything. Sure, architecture or defining a new Docker image could be a bit finicky at times, but hey, that's just how things worked. Is the persistent dockerd daemon eating upresources in the background with root privileges, just the price of doing business? I thought so.</p><p>If you are in this industry long enough, there is one pattern that emerges every day. Everybody begins questioning the "that's just how it's done" mentality. Along the way, the quiet Docker daemon running in the background felt less like a comfortable constant and more like a ticking bomb. More and more ways to explore this vulnerability emerged:</p><p><strong>2019-02-11 - CVE-2019-5736 (runC container escape):</strong> lets a process in a container overwrite the host&rsquo;s runc binary &rarr; full host compromise if exploited.</p><p><strong>2022-03-07 - CVE-2022-0847 &ldquo;Dirty Pipe&rdquo; (Linux kernel):</strong> read-only file overwrite in kernel; practical container-to-host abuse scenarios documented by Docker/Sysdig. </p><p><strong>2022-03-07 - CVE-2022-0492 (cgroups v1 release_agent):</strong> privilege escalation / container escape via cgroups v1; mitigations via seccomp/AppArmor/SELinux. </p><p><strong>2024-01-31 - CVE-2024-21626 (runC &ldquo;Leaky Vessels&rdquo;):</strong> fd leak + process.cwd issues enabling host FS access and potential escape; fixed in runC <strong>1.1.12</strong> (Docker Engine &ge; <strong>25.0.2</strong>). </p><p><strong>2024-02-01 - CVE-2024-23651/23652/23653 (BuildKit, &ldquo;Leaky Vessels&rdquo;):</strong> build-time issues that can affect host files; fixed in BuildKit <strong>0.12.5</strong>. </p><p><strong>2024-09-23 - In-the-wild cryptojacking campaign:</strong> attackers targeted exposed Docker APIs and microservices. </p><p><strong>2024-10-01 - Docker API swarm botnet campaign:</strong> cryptojacking via exposed Docker Engine API (<a href="https://securitylabs.datadoghq.com/articles/threat-actors-leveraging-docker-swarm-kubernetes-mine-cryptocurrency/">details</a>).</p><p>I had been seeking an alternative (I assumed that someone had already questioned the status quo), and that's how I stumbled into Podman territory. It began as casual curiosity - "<em>Hey, let me check out this thing</em>" - turned into a complete overhaul of my container workflows and pulled me into using Fedora in my home lab. And honestly? I wish I'd made the switch sooner.</p><h2>Daemonless</h2><p>Here's the fundamental issue that kept me awake: Docker's entire architecture is built around a persistent background service - the dockerd daemon. Whenever you run a docker command, you're actually talking to this daemon, which then does the heavy lifting. Sounds about right?</p><p>Yes?!</p><p>Or rather NO, because this daemon runs with root privileges. Always. And if something goes south with a daemon - innocent bug, a crash, or worst case scenario, a security exploit - your entire container ecosystem is potentially compromised. Not just the containers, daemon, or resource that you assigned to it, but the whole host system. It was a huge relief that Podman threw this model out the window. No daemon, no processes running in the background. When you run <code>podman run my-app</code>, the container becomes a direct child of your command. And it is running under your user privileges. Simple architecture change with huge implications:</p><h3>Security that actually makes sense:</h3><p>Remember those late-night security advisories about Docker daemon vulnerabilities (ex., when dockerd was misconfigured to listen on TCP:2375 without TLS, attackers could spin up privileged containers remotely)? With Podman, even if someone somehow escalates privileges inside a container to root level, they're still just an unprivileged user on the actual host. It significantly reduces the surface of an attack.</p><h3>No more single points of failure:</h3><p>Usually Docker daemon runs just fine. But when hiccups kick in - oh boy, hold your hats, as it will take down multiple containers at once. With Podman when one container crashed, the other kept running like nothing happened. It makes so much sense, and it's built in the spirit of hermetization.</p><h3>Lighter resource footprint:</h3><p>I had been surprised when my MacBook M2 Pro started to get warmer when left unattended. After a brief investigation (with Activity Monitor), it was obvious - Docker never knows when to stop. No constantly running daemon means less memory usage. Unfortunately, running a container using Podman can be a different story (ekhm: <a href="https://blog.podman.io/2025/06/podman-and-apple-rosetta/">blog.podman.io/2025/06/podman-and-apple-ros..</a>) - yet the thing is getting better: <a href="https://blog.podman.io/2025/08/podman-5-6-released-rosetta-status-update/">blog.podman.io/2025/08/podman-5-6-released-..</a>.</p><h2>Where Podman Really Shines</h2><p>Beyond the obvious daemon advantages, Podman brings some genuinely clever features that make day-to-day container work more pleasant:</p><p><strong>Systemd integration that doesn't suck:</strong> This one's huge if you're working on Linux servers (most of us are). Podman justgenerates proper systemd unit files. Boom, your container is a first-class citizen in the Linux service ecosystem. Boot dependencies, automatic restarts, resource limits - it all just works. I can run <code>podman generate systemd --name my-app</code> and get a clean service file. Afterwards, I can enable, start, stop, and monitor with standard systemctl commands. Say bye-bye to third-party process managers.</p><p><strong>Kubernetes alignment that's not just marketing:</strong> Since Red Hat (the folks behind Podman) is also a major Kubernetes contributor, the tool feels like it was designed with K8s in mind from day one. The native pod support isn't just a bolt-on feature - it's central to how Podman works. I do not need to run k3s or any local substitute for Kubernetes. Now, I can prototype multi-container applications as Podman pods locally. Then I just generate Kubernetes YAML directly from those pods with podman generate kube. My local development environment actually looks like what I'm going to deploy. This was revolutionary when I had to take over the responsibility of managing and developing a quite complex cluster.</p><p><strong>The Unix philosophy done right:</strong> Instead of trying to be everything to everyone, Podman focuses on running containers well and delegates specialized tasks to purpose - built tools. Need to build images with fine - grained control? That's Buildah. Want to inspect or copy images between registries? Skopeo's your friend. I can use the best tool for each job. I'm no longer stuck with whatever image-building quirks Docker decides to implement.</p><h2>The Migration That Wasn't Really a Migration</h2><p>Here's the part that surprised me most: switching from Docker to Podman was almost seamless. The Podman folks clearly understood that creating the next standard would not let them win the market, and they just adhered to the known CLI tool. I literally just aliased <code>docker=podman</code> in my shell and carried on with life. <code>podman run, podman build, podman ps</code> - they all behave exactly like their Docker counterparts. My existing Dockerfiles worked without modification. My muscle memory didn't need retraining.</p><p>Though there were a few places where I did hit differences that were actually improvements in disguise:</p><ul> <li><p>Privileged ports in rootless mode not working? Good! That's security working as intended. A reverse proxy setup is a better architecture anyway.</p></li> <li><p>Some volume permission quirks? Yes - but it's a small price, and again - if you do it right, you are limiting the scope of possible attack.</p></li> <li><p>A few legacy tools that expected the Docker socket? If there is no support by now, just remember that Podman can expose a Docker-compatible API if needed.</p></li> <li><p>If your Docker Compose workflow is overly complex, just convert it to Kubernetes YAML. We all use Kubernetes these days, so why even bother about this? Having the same layout for development and production is a huge bonus of doing so.</p></li> </ul> <h2>The Real-World Difference</h2><p>After six months of running Podman in production, here's what I've noticed:</p><p>I'm sleeping much better. Because I'm personally responsible for security, I do not have to check if every container is running in rootless mode. Something that I did not think I would benefit from is that my monitoring dashboards show cleaner resource usage patterns. Don't get me wrong - Docker isn't going anywhere. It has massive momentum, a mature ecosystem, and plenty of organizational inertia keeping it in place. But for new projects, or if you are able to make technical decisions based on merit rather than legacy, Podman represents a clear evolution in container technology. More secure by design, more aligned with Linux system management practices, and more thoughtfully architected for the way we actually deploy containers in 2025. The best way forward is to question the assumptions you didn't even realize you were making.</p><h2>FastAPI Migration Guide: From Docker to Podman</h2><p>Just to prove how easy transition can be, here's a practical walkthrough of migrating a FastAPI application from Docker to Podman. </p><h3>What You'll Need</h3><p>Your existing FastAPI project with its Dockerfile and requirements.txt</p><p>Podman is installed on your system:</p><ul> <li><p>Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt install podman</p></li> <li><p>Fedora/RHEL: sudo dnf install podman</p></li> <li><p>macOS: Grab Podman Desktop for a GUI experience</p></li> <li><p>Windows: If you are not a C# developer - stop doing this to yourself and just use Linux: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_RqZG6YR5M">youtube.com/watch?v=S_RqZG6YR5M</a></p></li> </ul> <h3>Step 1: Your Dockerfile Probably Just Works</h3><p>This is the beautiful part&mdash;Podman uses the same OCI container format as Docker. Your existing Dockerfile should work without any changes. Here's a typical FastAPI setup:</p><pre><code>FROM python:3.10-slim-buster WORKDIR /app COPY requirements.txt . RUN pip install --no-cache-dir --upgrade -r requirements.txt COPY . . EXPOSE 8000 CMD ["uvicorn", "app.main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"] </code></pre> <h3>Step 2: Build Your Image</h3><p>Instead of docker build, just run:</p><pre><code>podman build -t my-fastapi-app:latest . </code></pre><p>That's it. Same flags, same behavior, same output. If you want to ease the transition, create an alias:</p><pre><code><span>alias</span> docker=podman </code></pre><p>Now you can use your existing docker build commands without thinking about it.</p><h3>Step 3: Run Your Container</h3><p>For development and testing:</p><pre><code>podman run --rm -p 8000:8000 --name my-fastapi-container my-fastapi-app:latest </code></pre><p>For background services:</p><pre><code>podman run -d -p 8000:8000 --name my-fastapi-container my-fastapi-app:latest </code></pre><p>Your app should be accessible at <a href="http://localhost:8000">localhost:8000</a> just like before.</p><p><strong>Important note:</strong> <em>By default, Podman runs in rootless mode. This is a security win, but it means you can't bind directly to privileged ports (below 1024). For production, you'll want a reverse proxy anyway, so this pushes you toward better architecture.</em></p><h3>Step 4: Production Deployment with Systemd</h3><p>This is where Podman really shines. Instead of wrestling with custom service management, generate a proper systemd unit file:</p><pre><code><span># First, make sure your container is running</span> podman run -d -p 8000:8000 --name my-fastapi-container my-fastapi-app:latest <span># Generate the systemd service file</span> mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user/ podman generate systemd --name my-fastapi-container &gt; ~/.config/systemd/user/my-fastapi-container.service <span># Enable and start the service</span> systemctl --user daemon-reload systemctl --user <span>enable</span> my-fastapi-container.service systemctl --user start my-fastapi-container.service </code></pre><p>Now your FastAPI app is managed like any other system service. It'll start on boot, restart on failure, and integrate with standard Linux logging and monitoring tools.</p><p>For server deployments where you want the service to persist even when you're not logged in:</p><p>loginctl enable-linger $(whoami)</p><h3>Step 5: Multi-Service Applications with Pods</h3><p>If your FastAPI app needs a database or other services, Podman's pod concept is cleaner than Docker Compose for simple setups:</p><pre><code><span># Create a pod that shares networking</span> podman pod create --name my-fastapi-pod -p 8000:8000 -p 5432:5432 <span># Run your FastAPI app in the pod</span> podman run -d --pod my-fastapi-pod --name fastapi-app my-fastapi-app:latest <span># Run PostgreSQL in the same pod</span> podman run -d --pod my-fastapi-pod --name postgres-db -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword postgres:13 </code></pre><p>Now your FastAPI app can reach PostgreSQL at localhost:5432 because they share the same network namespace.</p><h3>Step 6: Docker Compose Compatibility</h3><p>For existing Docker Compose setups, you have options:</p><p><strong>Option 1:</strong> Use podman-compose as a drop-in replacement:</p><pre><code>pip install podman-compose podman-compose up -d </code></pre><p><strong>Option 2:</strong> Convert to Kubernetes YAML for a more cloud-native approach:</p><pre><code><span># Install kompose first</span> kompose convert -f docker-compose.yml -o k8s-manifest.yaml podman play kube k8s-manifest.yaml </code></pre><p>This second option is particularly nice if you're planning to deploy to Kubernetes eventually.</p><p><strong>Common Gotchas and Solutions</strong></p><p><strong>Volume permissions:</strong> If you hit permission issues with mounted volumes, remember that rootless containers run as your user. Make sure your user owns the directories you're mounting:</p><pre><code>chown -R $(id -un):$(id -gn) /path/to/your/data </code></pre><p><strong>Legacy tooling:</strong> Some tools expect the Docker socket at /var/run/docker.sock. Podman can provide a compatible API:</p><pre><code>systemctl --user <span>enable</span> podman.socket systemctl --user start podman.socket <span>export</span> DOCKER_HOST=unix://<span>$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR</span>/podman/podman.sock </code></pre><p><strong>Performance tuning:</strong> For production workloads, you might want to tune the rootless networking stack or consider running specific containers in rootful mode for maximum performance.</p><p>The migration process is usually much smoother than people expect. Start with a development environment, get comfortable with the workflow differences, then gradually move production workloads. The security and operational benefits make it worth the effort.</p></div></section>]]></description><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2025 20:30:48 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2025/09/40-years-later-are-bentleys-programming-pearls-still-relevant/</link><title>40 years later, are Bentley's "Programming Pearls" still relevant?

A collection of aphorisms designed to reveal truths about the field of programming.</p><p>It's 40 years later - long enough to see several revolutions in the field - so surely these are obsolete, right? They belong in the same category as "always carry a bundle of hay for the horses" or "you won't always have a pocket calculator with you" or "tie an onion on your belt to stay stylish".</p><p>Ah, my sweet summer child! <i>Plus &ccedil;a change, plus c'est la m&ecirc;me chose.</i> You'll find nearly everything in here depressingly relevant.</p><p>Before we dive in, a word for Bentley on the provenance of this collection:</p><p><a href="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/4284.315122.pdf">Programming Pearls.</a></p><blockquote><p>Although there is some truth in each saying in this column, all should be taken with a grain of salt. A word about credit. The name associated with a rule is usually the person who sent me the rule, even if they in fact attributed it to their Cousin Ralph (sorry, Ralph). In a few cases I have listed an earlier reference, together with the author&rsquo;s current affiliation (to the best of my knowledge). I&rsquo;m sure that I have slighted many people by denying them proper attribution, and to them I offer the condolence that Plagiarism is the sincerest form of flattery.</p></blockquote><p>Here we go!</p><h2> <a href="https://shkspr.mobi#coding">Coding</a> </h2> <blockquote><p>When in doubt, use brute force. Ken Thompson - Bell Labs</p></blockquote><p>Straight off the bat, a winner! Almost all problems are solvable through brute force. It may take time - but throw more resources at it! Once you know it <em>can</em> be done, then it is time to see <em>how</em> it can be done better.</p><blockquote><p>Avoid arc-sine and arc-cosine functions - you can usually do better by applying a trig identity or computing a vector dot-product. Jim Conyngham - Arvin/Calspan Advanced Technology Center</p></blockquote><p>And then, just like that, something broadly irrelevant today. These sorts of mathematical functions have been optimised so far that it probably doesn't matter which way you calculate them.</p><blockquote><p>Allocate four digits for the year part of a date: a new millenium is coming. David Martin - Norristown, Pennsylvania</p></blockquote><p><em>*weeps*</em> Why didn't they listen to you, David? While I would hope any code written this side of Y2K uses ISO8601, it is amusing that you still occasionally encounter people who want to save two bytes <em>somewhere</em>. Handy in some small systems, but mostly just a recipe for disaster. Looking at you, <a href="https://www.gps.gov/support/user/rollover/">GPS</a>!</p><blockquote><p>Avoid asymmetry. Andy Huber - Data General Corporation</p></blockquote><p>I'll be honest, I'm not sure what Andy is going on about here. I <em>assume</em> that he's talking about having the ability to go A-&gt;B without being able to go B-&gt;A. Equally, it could be about accepting data in one format and outputting it in a different format. <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33739184">Some more discussion on the topic</a>.</p><blockquote><p>The sooner you start to code, the longer the program will take. Roy Carlson - University of Wisconsin</p></blockquote><p><em>Bam!</em> Right in the truth. Much like <a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2014/03/29/sharp-axe/">the woodsman who spends his time sharpening his axe</a>, we know that diving into code is probably the least efficient way to create something.</p><blockquote><p>If you can&rsquo;t write it down in English, you can&rsquo;t code it. Peter Halpern - Brooklyn, New York</p></blockquote><p>So many bugs come from us not understanding the requirements of the user / customer.</p><blockquote><p>Details count. Peter Wrinberger - Bell Labs</p></blockquote><p>Hard agree, Pete! It's very easy to go for the "big picture" view of the software. But unless all those sharp edges are filed down, the code isn't going to have a happy life.</p><blockquote><p>If the code and the comments disagree, then both are probably wrong. Norm Schyer - Belt Labs</p></blockquote><p>Ah, the dream of self-documenting code will never be realised. Again, this goes back to our (in)ability to properly describe our requirements and our (in)adequacies at turning those comments into code.</p><blockquote><p>A procedure should fit on a page. David Tribble - Arlington, Texas</p></blockquote><p>Famously, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/24/the-two-pizza-rule-and-the-secret-of-amazons-success">Amazon has a "Two Pizza" rule</a> which defines the maximum size of a team. The larger and more complex something is, the more likely it is to go wrong. Yes, there are limits to <abbr title="Don't repeat yourself">DRY</abbr> and <abbr title="You ain't gonna need it">YAGNI</abbr> - but we seem firmly in the paradigm that large procedures / functions are ruinous to one's health.</p><blockquote><p>If you have too many special cases, you are doing it wrong. Craig Zerouni - Computer FX Ltd. London, England</p></blockquote><p><code>IF/ELSE</code> and <code>CASE/SWITCH</code> still really test our patience. Beautifully clean code which is ruined by special subroutines for rarely occurring situations. But it is hard to call them "wrong". Sometimes the world is complex and it is the job of computers to do the hard work for us.</p><blockquote><p>Get your data structures correct first, and the rest of the program will write itself. David Jones. Assen, The Netherlands</p></blockquote><p>Dave is right. A well-defined data structure is <em>still</em> the essence of most <abbr title="Create, read, update and delete">CRUD</abbr> systems.</p><h2> <a href="https://shkspr.mobi#user-interfaces">User Interfaces</a> </h2> <blockquote><p>[The Principle of Least Astonishment] Make a user interface as consistent and as predictable as possible. Contributed by several readers</p></blockquote><p><em>*weeps*</em> Why isn't this hammered into every programmer? Today's tools are filled with hidden UI gestures, random menus, and a complete disregard for the user's time.</p><blockquote><p>A program designed for inputs from people is usually stressed beyond the breaking point by computer-generated inputs. Dennis Ritchie. Bell Labs</p></blockquote><p>I think this one is mostly irrelevant now. Humans can only type at a limited speed, but computers can generate massive amounts of data instantly. But our machines' abilities to ingest that data has also grown. I suppose the nearest thing is the DDoS - where a webserver designed for a few visitors is overwhelmed by a flood of automated and malicious requests.</p><blockquote><p>Twenty percent of all input forms filled out by people contain bad data. Vic Vyssotsky. Bell Labs</p></blockquote><p>Ha! Vic didn't know that we'd have <code><input> validation in the 21st century! But, yeah, people write all sorts of crap into forms.</code></p><blockquote><p>Eighty percent of all input forms ask questions they have no business asking. Mike Garey. Bell Labs</p></blockquote><p>Mike was sent from the future to warn the people of the past - but they paid him no heed.</p><blockquote><p>Don't make the user provide information that the system already knows. Rick Lemons. Cardinal Data Systems</p></blockquote><p>I'm going to slightly disagree with Rick here. Asking for repeated information is a reasonable way to double-check you've got that information correct. It also helps to validate that the user is who they say they are.</p><blockquote><p>For 80 percent of all data sets, 95 percent of the information can be seen in a good graph. William S. Cleveland. Bell Labs</p></blockquote><p>Those of us who have seen <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anscombe's_quartet">Anscombe's quartet</a> know how true this is.</p><h2> <a href="https://shkspr.mobi#debugging">Debugging</a> </h2> <blockquote><p>Of all my programming bugs, 80 percent are syntax errors. Of the remaining 20 percent, 80 percent are trivial logical errors. Of the remaining 4 percent, 80 percent are pointer errors. And the remaining 0.8 percent are hard. Marc Donner. IBM T. J. Watson Research Center</p></blockquote><p>Syntax errors are rarer now that we have IDEs. And I hope visual programming languages will further reduce them. Logic errors still plague us. Pointer errors have been eradicated unless you're working at the very lowest levels. And I'd say the number of "hard" bugs is probably higher now due to the complex interaction of multiple libraries and systems.</p><blockquote><p>It takes three times the effort to find and fix bugs in system test than when done by the developer. It takes ten times the effort to find and fix bugs in the field than when done in system test. Therefore, insist on unit tests by the developer. Larry Bernstein. Bell Communications Research</p></blockquote><p>We can quibble about the numbers and the ratios - but it is generally harder to fix in prod. That said, getting crash logs from the field has considerable shortened those ratio.</p><blockquote><p>Don&rsquo;t debug standing up. It cuts your patience in half, and you need all you can muster. Dave Storer. Cedar Rapids, Iowa</p></blockquote><p>I'm with Team-Standing-Desk! So I think Dave is wrong.</p><blockquote><p>Don&rsquo;t get suckered in by the comments - they can be terribly misleading. Debug only the code. Dave Storer. Cedar Rapids, Iowa</p></blockquote><p>Hmmm. Yes, this is probably correct. I'm not going to say code is self-documenting these days; but it certainly is a lot easier to read.</p><blockquote><p>Testing can show the presence of bugs, but not their absence. Edsger W. Dijkstra. University of Texas</p></blockquote><p>Dare we disagree with Dijkstra?! Well, perhaps a little. With modern fuzzing tools we can show the absence of certain kinds of bugs.</p><blockquote><p>Each new user of a new system uncovers a new class of bugs. Brian Kernighan. Bell Labs</p></blockquote><p>Yup! Our code would be bug-free if it weren't for those pesky users!</p><blockquote><p>If it ain&rsquo;t broke, don&rsquo;t fix it. Ronald Reagan. Santa Barbara, California</p></blockquote><p>Amongst the many things about which to disagree with the former President, this is up there! Code needs maintenance. Some things aren't broke until all of a sudden they are. Sure, maybe don't change your app's layout because a manager wants a bonus; but things constantly need fixing.</p><blockquote><p>[The Maintainer&rsquo;s Motto] If we can&rsquo;t fix it, it ain&rsquo;t broke. Lieutenant Colonel Walt Weir. United States Army</p></blockquote><p>I believe in you. Self deprecation is fine, but self confidence is better.</p><blockquote><p>The first step in fixing a broken program is getting it to fail repeatably. Tom Duff. Bell Labs</p></blockquote><p>Yes! Transient errors are the worst! And a huge source of the "it works for me" antipattern.</p><h2> <a href="https://shkspr.mobi#performance">Performance</a> </h2> <blockquote><p>[The First Rule of Program Optimization] Don&rsquo;t do it. [The Second Rule of Program Optimization - for experts only] Don't do it yet. Michael Jackson. Michael Jackson Systems Ltd.</p></blockquote><p>As true now as it ever was.</p><blockquote><p>The fastest algorithm can frequently be replaced by one that is almost as fast and much easier to understand. Douglas W. Jones. University of Iowa</p></blockquote><p>I'm only <em>mostly</em> in agreement here. Many of the security bugs we see in modern code are due to "clever" tricks which turn out to have nasty strings attached. But, at the microcode level, performance is still everything. And a well-tested fast algorithm may be necessary. As part of the climate crisis we should all be thinking about the efficiency of our code.</p><blockquote><p>On some machines indirection is slower with displacement, so the most-used member of a structure or a record should be first. Mike Morton. Boston, Massachusetts</p></blockquote><p>We live in an age of ridiculously fast SSD and RAM access times. Sequential reads are still slightly faster than random jumps, and structures like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-tree">B-Tree</a> give us a good mix of the two. We don't need to align data to the physical tracks of a spinning disk any more.</p><blockquote><p>In non-I/O-bound programs, a few percent of the source code typically accounts for over half the run time. Don Knuth. Stanford University</p></blockquote><p>I wonder how true this now is? Perhaps we could replace "I/O" with "Internet requests" and still be accurate?</p><blockquote><p>Before optimizing, use a profiler to locate the &ldquo;hot spots&rdquo; of the program. Mike Morton. Boston, Massachusetts</p></blockquote><p>Mostly true. But you don't lose much by doing some manual optimisations that you know (from bitter experience) will make a difference.</p><blockquote><p>[Conservation of Code Size] When you turn an ordinary page of code into just a handful of instructions for speed, expand the comments to keep the number of source lines, constant. Mike Morton. Boston, Massachusetts</p></blockquote><p>I don't think this is relevant these days. Perhaps it is useful to spend time explaining exactly what trickery you're pulling off with weird syntax. But our tools are now line-count agnostic. Mostly.</p><blockquote><p>If the programmer can simulate a construct faster than the compiler can implement the construct itself, then the compiler writer has blown it badly. Guy L. Steele, Jr. Tartan Laboratories</p></blockquote><p>I think this is rather self-evident. But compilers are so ridiculously optimised that this scenario is increasingly rare.</p><blockquote><p>To speed up an I/O-bound program, begin by accounting for all I/O. Eliminate that which is unnecessary or redundant, and make the remaining as fast as possible. David Martin. Norristown, Pennsylvania</p></blockquote><p>I think this can be generalised even further. I'm reminded of <a href="https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/11283">NPM's progress bar slowdown issue</a>. There's a lot of redundancy which can be removed in many programs.</p><blockquote><p>The fastest I/O is no I/O. Nils-Peter Nelson. Bell Labs</p></blockquote><p>Man! They were <em>obsessed</em> with I/O back in the day! At large volumes, it is still an issue. But perhaps now we can relax just a little?</p><blockquote><p>The cheapest, fastest, and most reliable components of a computer system are those that aren&rsquo;t there. Gordon Bell. Encore Computer Corporation</p></blockquote><p>A little unfair, I think. It's cheaper to have less RAM, but that doesn't make my laptop faster.</p><blockquote><p>[Compiler Writer&rsquo;s Motto-Optimization Pass] Making a wrong program worse is no sin. Bill McKeeman. Wang Znstitute</p></blockquote><p>Personally, I don't think it is the compiler's job to tell me I'm doing it wrong.</p><blockquote><p>Electricity travels a foot in a nanosecond. Commodore Grace Murray Hopper. United States Navy</p></blockquote><p>And a nano-Century is Pi seconds! One of those pub-trivia facts which are irrelevant to modern computing.</p><blockquote><p>LISP programmers know the value of everything but the cost of nothing. Alan Perlis. Yale University</p></blockquote><p>Nowadays LISP programmers are a protected species and shouldn't be subject to such harsh treatment.</p><blockquote><p>[Little&rsquo;s Formula] The average number of objects in a queue is the product of the entry rate and the average holding time. Richard E. Fairley. Wang Institute</p></blockquote><p>Another of those truisms which kinda don't matter in a world with infinite disk space. Speed is our greatest worry.</p><h2> <a href="https://shkspr.mobi#documentation">Documentation</a> </h2> <blockquote><p>[The Test of Negation] Don&rsquo;t include a sentence in documentation if its negation is obviously false. Bob Martin. AT&amp;T Technologies</p></blockquote><p>I don't know if that's the same guy as <a href="https://blog.wesleyac.com/posts/robert-martin">Uncle Bob</a> - but it sounds like the sort of claptrap he'd come up with. What's obvious to you might not be obvious to others. Test your writing with your audience to see if they understand your meaning.</p><blockquote><p>When explaining a command, or language feature, or hardware widget, first describe the problem it is designed to solve. David Martin. Norristown, Pennsylvania</p></blockquote><p>Agreed. It doesn't need to be an essay, but documentation needs context.</p><blockquote><p>[One Page Principle] A (specification, design, procedure, test plan) that will not fit on one page of 8.5-by-11 inch paper cannot be understood. Mark Ardis. Wang Institute</p></blockquote><p>I do have some sympathy with this - see the Two-Pizza rule above - but I think this ignores the reality of modern systems. Yes, we should keep things simple, but we also have to recognise that complexity is unavoidable.</p><blockquote><p>The job&rsquo;s not over until the paperwork&rsquo;s done.

And if you must write a program, use existing code to do as much of the work as possible. Richard Hill. Hewlett-Packard S.A. Geneva, Switzerland</p></blockquote><p>This is the open source way. Much easier to fork than start again. But at some point you'll run up against an unwanted design decision which will be load-bearing.

Douglas W. Jones University of Iowa</p></blockquote><p>I honestly don't know how true that is any more. Automated tools must surely have improved that somewhat?</p><blockquote><p>Don&rsquo;t use the computer to do things that can be done efficiently by hand. Richard Hill. Hewlett-Packard S.A. Geneva, Switzerland</p></blockquote><p>A rare disagreement! Things can be efficiently done by hand <em>once or twice</em> but after that, go nuts! Even if it's something as simple as renaming a dozen files in a directory, you'll learn something interesting from automating it.</p><blockquote><p>I&rsquo;d rather write programs to write programs than write programs.

Bill McKeeman. Wang Institute</p></blockquote><p>Yes. It is always tempting to go for the big win. But baby-steps!</p><blockquote><p>Furious activity is no substitute for understanding. H. H. Williams. Oakland, California</p></blockquote><p>Goodness me, yes! It's always tempting to rush in pell-mell. But that's a poor use of time.</p><blockquote><p>Always do the hard part first. If the hard part is impossible, why waste time on the easy part? Once the hard part is done, you&rsquo;re home free. Always do the easy part first.

Bell Labs</p></blockquote><p>Oh, Al! You card! Luckily, there are very few "basic" problems to be solved in modern computing. We know what most of the hard problems are. Perhaps Agile teaches us to always leave software in a working state, so we start with the easy parts?</p><blockquote><p>If you lie to the computer, it will get you. Perry Farrar. Germantown, Maryland</p></blockquote><p>We shouldn't anthropomorphise computers; they don't like it. Actually, nowadays it's is quite common to "lie" to computers with dummy data and virtualised environments. It's fine.</p><blockquote><p>If a system doesn&rsquo;t have to be reliable, it can do anything else. H. H. Williams.

Instead of symbols and punctuation, you write in full sentences like:</p><pre><code>set the greeting to &quot;Hello World&quot;.show on screen the greeting.</code></pre><p>From a technical standpoint, there were a few interesting challenges i thought might be worth sharing here:</p><ul><li><strong>Parsing “loose” English</strong>: Traditional parsers expect rigid grammar. PlainLang allows optional words like “the”, “a”, or “then”, so the parser had to be tolerant without losing structure. I ended up with a recursive descent parser tuned for flexibility, which was trickier than expected.</li><li><strong>Pronoun support</strong>: The language lets you use “it” to refer to the last computed result. That required carrying contextual state across statements in the runtime, a design pattern that feels simple in usage but was subtle to implement correctly.</li><li><strong>Error messages that feel human</strong>: If someone writes <code>add 5 to score</code> without first setting <code>score</code>, the runtime tries to explain it in plain terms rather than spitting out a stack trace. Writing helpful diagnostics for “English-like” code took some care.</li></ul><p>The project is still young, but it already supports variables, arithmetic, conditionals, loops, and an interactive REPL.</p><p>I’d be interested in hearing from others who have tried making more “human-readable” languages what trade-offs did you find between natural syntax and precise semantics?</p><p>The code is open source (MIT license)   </p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section><section class='separator separator-after-selftext'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='parsed-content'><div><article><h2>Plain Programming Language</h2><a href="https://github.com#plain-programming-language"></a><p><a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT"><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/6cd0120cc4c5ac11d28b2c60f76033b52db98dac641de3b2644bb054b449d60c/68747470733a2f2f696d672e736869656c64732e696f2f62616467652f4c6963656e73652d4d49542d79656c6c6f772e737667" alt="License: MIT"></a> <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/"><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/b46f750af5c3a98977b2d984c82741c8b78d3e08b3621bfb890e2364200d7679/68747470733a2f2f696d672e736869656c64732e696f2f62616467652f727573742d312e37302532422d6f72616e6765" alt="Rust"></a></p><p>Plain is a minimalist, English-like programming language designed to make programming feel like natural conversation.

That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d like to explore: the emotional toll of refusing &ndash; on ourselves and on those we ask for something, even when we reassure them, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s totally fine if you can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><h2>It&rsquo;s hard to refuse &ndash; and all too easy to agree</h2><p>Overall, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2443710/">saying <em>no</em> often carries negative connotations</a>, which is why we tend to avoid it. We dislike being in situations where <strong>our words or actions might be perceived as negative</strong>. It becomes even more difficult to decline in person &ndash; especially when we know the person well or feel emotionally connected to them or the topic.</p><blockquote><p>People are generally more dismissive online or in anonymous settings, where <strong>the perceived consequences are minimal</strong>. It&rsquo;s much easier to ignore or mock a request to &ldquo;like&rdquo; a post on social media than to say <em>no</em> to your mum when she asks for help picking apples.</p></blockquote><p>In a professional setting, declining becomes even more complicated.</p><p>We&rsquo;ve created a work culture where <strong>declining requests too often can feel like a career risk</strong>, especially for <a href="https://shiftmag.dev/the-journey-of-a-lone-female-software-developer-2876/">women</a> and members of <a href="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/features/a36687625/naomi-osaka-and-the-cost-of-saying-no/">minority groups</a>. Declining isn&rsquo;t only disappointing for the person who asked; it might also mean missing out on a promotion or an exciting opportunity. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carp">Holy carp</a>!</p><p>Conversely, <strong>accepting is effortless</strong>. </p><p>It feels nice and positive. You&rsquo;re pleasing the other person, maybe even securing a future reward for yourself. What could be better? Since <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_discounting">humans are wired to chase immediate rewards</a> and often <a href="http://spia.uga.edu/faculty_pages/tyler.scott/teaching/PADP6950_Spring2017/Readings/Odonoghue.Rabin.2000.pdf">overlook future pain</a>, we tend to say <em>yes</em> just to see that happy twinkle in someone&rsquo;s eye &ndash; consequences be damned!</p><p>If you Google <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+say+no">&ldquo;how to say no&rdquo;</a>, you&rsquo;ll get a lot of results, mostly focused on the actual skill of rejecting something. If you Google <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+say+yes">&ldquo;how to say yes&rdquo;</a>, you mostly get results about how to say words and phrases in different languages. <strong>Declining is a tricky soft skill</strong>; accepting is often just about language.</p><h2><span>Turning something down is&hellip; stressful.</span></h2><p>So, where are we with <em>no</em>?</p><ul> <li>We&rsquo;re not that great at saying it.</li> <li>It&rsquo;s not a pleasant thing to do.</li> <li>It can have negative consequences.</li> </ul><p>As a result,<strong> it&rsquo;s often stressful to refuse a request</strong>. </p><p>We tend to worry about it before, during, and after the fact. This stress can be even worse if we&rsquo;re already dealing with things like <strong>burnout, impostor syndrome, or anxiety</strong>. Saying <em>no</em> in those situations can feel like adding fuel to the fire. If I already don&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;m doing a stellar job, turning something down might only reinforce the fear that others see me as a failure.</p><blockquote><p>Our tendency toward <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_mentality">herd mentality</a> doesn&rsquo;t help either. When most of the team says <em>yes</em> and we&rsquo;re the only ones who want to say <em>no</em>, <strong>we often end up going along with the group</strong>, even if we feel conflicted inside.</p></blockquote><p>Many of us have experienced this in sprint planning and sprint reviews &ndash; the team takes on more work than necessary during planning to avoid refusing requests, and then feels deflated and disappointed when they can&rsquo;t deliver everything by the end. Over time, this can <strong>hurt team morale and spirit</strong>, lower motivation, and even create a toxic dynamic between teams and their stakeholders.</p><p>All of this leads to a simple point: <strong>refusing comes with its own burden</strong>. Telling someone to &ldquo;just say <em>no</em>&rdquo; can be disingenuous &ndash; placing the emotional and social cost of rejection on them, while pretending it&rsquo;s easy.</p><h2><span>Expecting a simple refusal hurts the ones who care most</span></h2><p>The people who are most invested in a project, those who care deeply about the quality of their work and their team&rsquo;s delivery, often your &ldquo;best performers&rdquo;, are <strong>usually the ones who find it hardest to say <em>no</em></strong>. As a result, they often take the initiative to pick up tasks that others might reject.</p><p>If you keep asking, they may continue to agree, depending on their situation, until they eventually hit a wall and burn out.</p><h2><span>Be kind. Don&rsquo;t act like <em>no</em> is just a simple word</span></h2><p>We should be<strong> mindful of our colleagues&rsquo; workloads</strong> and, whenever possible, avoid asking them for additional tasks if we know they might already have a full plate. </p><blockquote><p>It&rsquo;s important to recognize that they may feel unable or reluctant to refuse, even when they want to. And even when they do refuse, it can still come at a cost to their emotional well-being or personal life.</p></blockquote><p>We should also recognize that <strong>refusal comes in many forms</strong>. It can mean:</p><ul> <li>Literally saying <em>no</em>.</li> <li>Taking only 5 tasks out of 10 that were offered.</li> <li>Choosing not to volunteer when most others do.</li> <li>Not attending a meeting or participating in a Slack discussion.</li> </ul><p>All of the above can be difficult to do and <strong>may lead to negative consequences down the road</strong>, for both the individual and the team.</p><h2><span>What&rsquo;s the solution?</span></h2> <ul> <li><strong>Talk openly with your colleagues.</strong> Be aware of the challenges they face and the workloads they carry. Don&rsquo;t expect them to simply reject additional work &ndash; understand their situation through honest conversations.</li> <li><strong>Keep expectations realistic.</strong> Avoid presenting people or teams with overwhelming wish lists they can&rsquo;t reasonably deliver. Don&rsquo;t assume others will just say <em>no</em> to unreasonable demands.</li> <li><strong>Diversify your requests for help.</strong> Instead of always turning to the same people who tend to say <em>yes</em>, reach out to others and distribute the load more evenly.</li> <li><strong>Avoid herd mentality pressure.</strong> Give individuals space and time to make decisions independently, and encourage sharing outcomes in a safe environment. This is why practices like writing retrospective points individually or revealing estimations simultaneously in planning poker are important.</li> <li><strong>Lead by example.</strong> Show that saying <em>no</em> when it&rsquo;s appropriate is acceptable. Recognize that you might also struggle with this and discuss it openly with your team.</li> <li><strong>Establish fair systems and processes.</strong> Ensure workloads are distributed transparently and fairly, rather than relying on informal methods that often favor those who find it easier to say <em>no</em> &ndash; which can unfairly burden those who care most about the project&rsquo;s success.</li> <li><strong>Don&rsquo;t reward or idolize overwork.</strong> Encourage a culture that values balance and sustainable effort over relentless hustle.</li> </ul> </div></section>]]></description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2025 23:05:17 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://open.substack.com/pub/softwarearthopod/p/vibe-coding-our-way-to-disaster?r=ww6gs&amp;&amp;&amp;showWelcomeOnShare=true</link><title>Are We Vibecoding Our Way to Disaster?

His talks have only become more relevant since then, as we are now being inundated with AI-written code.</span></p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxdOUGdseq4">Simple Made Easy</a><span> distinguishes between simplicity (things that aren't intertwined with other things) and ease (things that are familiar or quick to use). The distinction matters because we often choose easy solutions that create complex, tangled systems.</span></p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f84n5oFoZBc">Hammock-Driven Development</a><span> advocates deep, unhurried thinking about problems before writing code. Hickey argues that most critical bugs actually result from misunderstanding the problem rather than implementation errors.</span></p><p>As I've worked with coding agents over the past year, I keep returning to these principles. They provide a framework for understanding why some AI-assisted development results in high-quality software, while others create a complex mess. The key insight: AI tools amplify whatever approach you bring to them. If you rush to code without understanding the problem, AI helps you build the wrong solution. If you think deeply first, AI becomes a powerful tool for implementing well-considered solutions.</p><p>Hickey makes a distinction between simple and easy that at first sounds pedantic. Simple meaning: a single braid, one responsibility, or one concept that doesn't touch anything else. Easy, meaning the thing you reach for automatically. The familiar choice. The solution you can implement without a design doc. The easy approach seduces you because it asks nothing of you in return for using it. The definition of simple really has no overlap with easy, but it is a common idea that simple things are easy, which is not always the case.</p><p>This distinction becomes clearer today when using AI coding agents. The easy approach is to open a chat and start vibe coding your app, iterating through conversation after conversation. It feels natural and productive. The AI responds quickly, code appears, and you can see immediate progress.</p><p>But this easy path comes at the cost of a special kind of complexity: context complexity. As conversations grow longer, the AI's context window fills with corrections, clarifications, searches, tool invocations, and evolving requirements. You are stacking complexity without realizing it. Earlier thoughtful design decisions get buried under the frustration of revisions. The AI starts making connections between these unrelated parts of the conversation, and your focused task dissolves into partial solutions and conflicting approaches, each one 'fixing' the problems created by the last.</p><p>Vibe coding is explicitly choosing ease over simplicity, just as Hickey warned. The comfortable, conversational interface of AI assistants makes it tempting to skip the hard work of clearly defining what we're building. We let the software evolve organically, which feels productive but inevitably creates exactly what Hickey calls "complected" (unnecessarily intertwined) systems. Our context complexity becomes code complexity, and every clarification and correction in the chat history gets woven into the implementation.</p><p>'Hammock-Driven Development' presents an idea that has influenced the way I work, even before working with AI tools. Rich Hickey argues that the most critical software bugs arise from misunderstanding the problem itself, not from implementation errors.</p><p>He demonstrates how our best solutions emerge from harnessing our brain's natural creative process. The analytical mind specializes in gathering information and critiquing ideas, but it gets trapped in familiar patterns of problems it has previously solved. The background mind synthesizes and connects ideas in new ways, but only when we give it space to work. You can't force it to work.</p><p>Hickey's approach maps directly onto the four stages of creative thought, a framework from Graham Wallas's work in the 1920s:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Preparation</strong><span>: Loading up your analytical mind with information. In software, this means understanding the problem domain, exploring existing solutions, and identifying constraints. Hickey emphasizes that we often rush this stage, but it's the foundation for everything else. You need to gather the raw material before your brain can do anything useful with it.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Incubation</strong><span>: Stepping away from the keyboard. Your background mind processes the information you've gathered, making connections your conscious mind wouldn't make. This is why solutions often come during walks, showers, or lying in a hammock. The key is to actually step away after thorough preparation. (This can also show up as having nightmares about JavaScript)</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Illumination</strong><span>: The eureka moments when connections suddenly become clear. These insights feel like they come from nowhere, but they're actually the result of your background mind's processing during incubation. Hickey notes these moments often reveal simpler solutions than what your analytical mind was initially pursuing.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Verification</strong><span>: Testing whether the insight actually works. This brings the analytical mind back into play, but now it's working with a fundamentally different approach born from synthesis rather than incremental analysis. Not every insight survives verification, but the ones that do often solve the real problem.</span></p></li></ol><p><span>This focus on disciplined thinking led me to a revelation about AI tools. As I've worked with coding agents over the last few months, I noticed that the most successful agent runs were not from writing the best prompts, but from applying Hickey's preparation phase upfront. This realization led me to develop what I at the time called</span><a href="https://x.com/nayshins/status/1925710279217754123">The Context Compression Funnel</a><span> - later coined by others as </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw">Context Engineering</a><span> (a much more marketable term, let's be honest). Context engineering is the discipline of designing what an AI sees before it responds - not just the prompt, but all the supporting information, tools, and structure needed to get reliable results.</span></p><div><figure><a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Zov0!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5a4d3fb9-67eb-46dc-a2e9-26cb54884cba_589x652.png"></a></figure></div><p>The core insight is that we should treat AI agents not as conversational partners but as powerful tools whose context must be carefully managed. Just as Hickey advocates for choosing simple constructs over complex ones, we need to opt for simple interaction patterns that provide context upfront over the ease of conversational threads.</p><p>So how do we apply Hickey's principles to AI development? I've found success with three distinct phases that force us to think before we code. This approach directly applies Hickey's principles to prevent the complexity that naturally emerges from unstructured AI interactions.</p><p>The first phase treats the AI as a research assistant focused solely on understanding the problem space. Given a high-level goal, the AI explores the codebase to identify all relevant components. The output is a research document that maps the terrain we'll be working in.</p><p>This phase embodies Hickey's emphasis on thoroughly understanding the problem before attempting solutions. The AI can quickly traverse large codebases, identifying dependencies and relationships that provide crucial context. For instance, discovering that what seemed like a simple UI change actually touches three different API endpoints and a shared state manager. But the key to thinking deeply is that we stop here and review this research before proceeding.</p><p>The human review at this checkpoint represents the highest-leverage intervention in the entire process. By validating the AI's understanding of the problem space early on, we prevent cascading errors that would be far more costly to fix later. This is our "waking mind" actively framing the problem correctly.</p><p>With the validated research in hand, the second phase asks the AI to create a detailed implementation plan. This plan should be so explicit that any developer could follow it - specifying which files to modify, what functions to create, and how components will interact.</p><p>This phase directly implements the principle of separating concerns. By distinguishing the "what" (the plan) from the "how" (the implementation), we create a simple, reviewable specification. The plan itself becomes a design artifact that embodies our thinking about the solution.</p><p>The human review step is the opportunity for you to do a design review. We're not looking at code yet; we're just evaluating the approach. Does this plan maintain proper separation of concerns? Are we tangling together things that should remain separate? This is where we apply what Hickey calls our "entanglement radar" - spotting when things are getting unnecessarily intertwined.</p><p>Only after validating both our understanding and our plan do we move to implementation. This is where all of the upfront work pays off: the AI now has a clear specification to follow, dramatically reducing the chance of drift or confusion.</p><p>This final phase becomes pleasingly straightforward. Because we've already done the hard work of thinking and planning ahead of time, the AI can focus on translating the plan into code. The context remains clean and focused, preventing the accumulation of complexity that inevitably strangles long conversational sessions.</p><div><figure><a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UC4a!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc7aa3030-eec5-4b65-830f-c3f128ac5a2c_704x658.png"></a></figure></div><p>Hickey's emphasis on simplicity becomes even more valuable when working with AI agents. Their power and ease of use make it easy to create new applications faster than ever, but these vibe-coded applications are a mess of complexity (and hilarious security issues). By structuring our interactions to maintain simplicity, we harness AI's capabilities while avoiding its pitfalls.</p><p>The discipline of "hammock time" thinking is translated into our phased approach. We're building in moments of reflection and review, ensuring that human judgment guides the process. The AI amplifies our capabilities, but the crucial thinking work remains fundamentally human.</p><p>More importantly, we're maintaining focus on solving problems rather than just producing code. Hickey argued that we should think more about the problem space than the solution space. Our methodology ensures that two-thirds of the process (research and planning) is dedicated to understanding and designing before any implementation begins.</p><p>As AI coding assistants become more powerful and prevalent, the temptation to use them in "easy" ways will only grow stronger. We'll see tools that promise even more magical transformations from description to implementation. But Hickey's warnings about choosing ease over simplicity will remain relevant.</p><p>The methodology I've outlined goes beyond productivity with AI tools. At its core, it maintains the discipline and thoughtfulness that creates maintainable, understandable systems. It recognizes that the hard work of thinking can't be outsourced to AI, only amplified by it.</p><p>I encourage you to experiment with this approach in your own AI-assisted development. Start by being deliberate about the phases of Research, Planning, and Implementation. Resist the temptation to jump straight into code generation. Permit yourself to spend time thinking. You might find, as I have, that slowing down at key moments actually speeds up the overall process while producing dramatically simpler results.</p><p>AI assistants are here to stay in software development. We must choose to do the work to build elegantly simple systems rather than succumb to the ease of vibe-coded complexity. Hickey gave us the principles.

I&rsquo;m really angry. I&rsquo;m angry in a knocking down sandcastles and punching Daniel LaRusso in the face and talking smack about him to his girl kind of way.</p><p>I&rsquo;m not an angry person generally, but I can&rsquo;t stand what&rsquo;s happening to my industry. </p><p><span>I know software development. I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 25 years, maybe even 28 years</span><span><a href="https://mikelovesrobots.substack.com/p/wheres-the-shovelware-why-ai-coding#footnote-1-172538377">1</a></span><span> if you count market research tabulation on amber monochrome screens. Yes, I&rsquo;m old. I&rsquo;m a middle-aged programming nerd. My entire life and personal identity are wrapped up in this programming thing for better or worse. I thrive off the dopamine hits from shipping cool things.</span></p><p><span>I was an early adopter of AI coding and a fan until maybe two months ago, when I read the </span><a href="https://metr.org/blog/2025-07-10-early-2025-ai-experienced-os-dev-study/">METR study</a><span> and suddenly got serious doubts. In that study, the authors discovered that developers were unreliable narrators of their own productivity. They thought AI was making them 20% faster, but it was actually making them 19% slower. This shocked me because I had just told someone the week before that I thought AI was only making me about 25% faster, and I was bummed it wasn&rsquo;t a higher number. I was only off by 5% from the developer&rsquo;s own incorrect estimates.</span></p><p>This was unsettling. It was impossible not to question if I too were an unreliable narrator of my own experience. Was I hoodwinked by the screens of code flying by and had no way of quantifying whether all that reading and reviewing of code actually took more time in the first place than just doing the thing myself?</p><p>So, I started testing my own productivity using a modified methodology from that study. I&rsquo;d take a task and I&rsquo;d estimate how long it would take to code if I were doing it by hand, and then I&rsquo;d flip a coin, heads I&rsquo;d use AI, and tails I&rsquo;d just do it myself. Then I&rsquo;d record when I started and when I ended. That would give me the delta, and I could use the delta to build AI vs no AI charts, and I&rsquo;d see some trends. I ran that for six weeks, recording all that data, and do you know what I discovered?</p><p>I discovered that the data isn&rsquo;t statistically significant at any meaningful level. That I would need to record new datapoints for another four months just to prove if AI was speeding me up or slowing me down at all. It&rsquo;s too neck-in-neck.</p><p>That lack of differentiation between the groups is really interesting though. Yes, it&rsquo;s a limited sample and could be chance, but also so far AI appears to slow me down by a median of 21%, exactly in line with the METR study. I can say definitively that I&rsquo;m not seeing any massive increase in speed (i.e., 2x) using AI coding tools. If I were, the results would be statistically significant and the study would be over.</p><p>That&rsquo;s really disappointing.</p><p>I wish the AI coding dream were true. I wish I could make every dumb coding idea I ever had a reality. I wish I could make a fretboard learning app on Monday, a Korean trainer on Wednesday, and a video game on Saturday. I&rsquo;d release them all. I&rsquo;d drown the world in a flood of shovelware like the world had never seen. Well, I would &mdash; if it worked.</p><p><span>It turns out, though, and I&rsquo;ve collected a lot of data on this, it doesn&rsquo;t just not work for me, </span><strong>it doesn&rsquo;t work for anyone</strong><span>, and I&rsquo;m going to prove that.</span></p><p><span>But first, let&rsquo;s examine how extreme and widespread these productivity claims are. Cursor&rsquo;s tagline is &ldquo;Built to make you extraordinarily productive.&rdquo; Claude Code&rsquo;s is &ldquo;Build Better Software Faster.&rdquo; GitHub Copilot&rsquo;s is &ldquo;Delegate like a boss.&rdquo; Google says their LLMs make their developers 25% faster. OpenAI makes their own bombastic claims about their coding efficiencies and studies</span><span><a href="https://mikelovesrobots.substack.com/p/wheres-the-shovelware-why-ai-coding#footnote-2-172538377">2</a></span><span>. And my fellow developers themselves are no better, with 14% claiming they&rsquo;re seeing a 10x increase in output due to AI.</span><span><a href="https://mikelovesrobots.substack.com/p/wheres-the-shovelware-why-ai-coding#footnote-3-172538377">3</a></span></p><p><em>&ldquo;Delegate like a boss&rdquo; &ndash; Github Copilot</em></p><div><p><span>These claims wouldn't matter if the topic weren't so deadly serious. Tech leaders everywhere are buying into the FOMO, convinced their competitors are getting massive gains they're missing out on. This drives them to rebrand as AI-First companies</span><span><a href="https://mikelovesrobots.substack.com/p/wheres-the-shovelware-why-ai-coding#footnote-4-172538377">4</a></span><span>, justify layoffs with newfound productivity narratives, and lowball developer salaries under the assumption that AI has fundamentally changed the value equation.</span></p><p><span>And yet, despite the most widespread adoption one could imagine</span><span><a href="https://mikelovesrobots.substack.com/p/wheres-the-shovelware-why-ai-coding#footnote-5-172538377">5</a></span><span>, </span><strong>these tools don&rsquo;t work</strong><span>.</span></p></div><p><strong>My argument: If so many developers are so extraordinarily productive using these tools, where is the flood of shovelware?</strong><span> We should be seeing apps of all shapes and sizes, video games, new websites, mobile apps, software-as-a-service apps &mdash; we should be drowning in choice. We should be in the middle of an indie software revolution. We should be seeing 10,000 Tetris clones on Steam.</span></p><div><p><strong>Consider this: </strong><span>with all you know about AI-assisted coding and its wide adoption, if I showed you charts and graphs of new software releases across the world, what shape of that graph would you expect? Surely you&rsquo;d be seeing an exponential growth up-and-to-the-right as adoption took hold and people started producing more?</span></p><p><span>Now, I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of money and weeks putting the data for this article together, processing tens of terabytes of data in some cases. So I hope you appreciate how utterly uninspiring and flat these charts are across every major sector of software development. </span></p></div><div><figure><a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!eBmO!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4e23e3e0-d046-4b58-ab6d-bb8e78d38493_664x415.png"></a><figcaption><span>I spent $70 on BigQuery processing to make this chart. Via </span><a href="https://www.gharchive.org/">GH Archive</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>The most interesting thing about these charts is what they&rsquo;re not showing. They&rsquo;re not showing a sudden spike or hockey-stick line of growth. They&rsquo;re flat at best. There&rsquo;s no shovelware surge. There&rsquo;s no sudden indie boom occurring post-2022/2023. You could not tell looking at these charts when AI-assisted coding became widely adopted. The core premise is flawed. Nobody is shipping more than before.</p><p><span>The impact on human lives is incredible. People are being fired because they&rsquo;re not adopting these tools fast enough</span><span><a href="https://mikelovesrobots.substack.com/p/wheres-the-shovelware-why-ai-coding#footnote-6-172538377">6</a></span><span>. People are sitting in jobs they don&rsquo;t like because they&rsquo;re afraid if they go somewhere else it&rsquo;ll be worse. People are spending all this time trying to get good at prompting and feeling bad because they&rsquo;re failing.</span></p><p>This whole thing is bullshit.</p><p>So if you're a developer feeling pressured to adopt these tools &mdash; by your manager, your peers, or the general industry hysteria &mdash; trust your gut. If these tools feel clunky, if they're slowing you down, if you're confused how other people can be so productive, you're not broken. The data backs up what you're experiencing. You're not falling behind by sticking with what you know works. If you&rsquo;re feeling brave, show your manager these charts and ask them what they think about it.</p><p>If you take away anything from this it should be that (A) developers aren't shipping anything more than they were before (that&rsquo;s the only metric that matters), and (B) if someone &mdash; whether it's your CEO, your tech lead, or some Reddit dork &mdash; claims they're now a 10xer because of AI, that&rsquo;s almost assuredly untrue, demand they show receipts or shut the fuck up.</p><p>Now, I know the internet. I know what many of you chumps are going to say before you even say it, so let&rsquo;s just get into it:</p><ol><li><p><em>&ldquo;Well, if you just learned how to prompt properly, then you would be a 10x engineer like me.&rdquo;</em><br><span>Look at the data. There are no new 10xers. If there were &mdash; if the 14% of self-proclaimed AI 10xers were actually 10xers &mdash; that would more than double the worldwide output of new software. That didn&rsquo;t happen. And as for you, personally, show me the 30 apps you created this year. I&rsquo;m not entertaining this without receipts.</span></p></li><li><p><em><span>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s a new technology and so much is invested, and it takes time&hellip;&rdquo;</span><br></em><span>Yes, billions of dollars have been invested in these tools. Billions of dollars will continue to be invested in these tools. The problem is that they&rsquo;re being sold and decisions are being made about them &mdash; which affect real people&rsquo;s lives &mdash; as if they work today. Don&rsquo;t parrot that nonsense to me that it&rsquo;s a work in progress. It&rsquo;s September 2025, and we&rsquo;ve had these tools for years now, and they still suck. Someday, maybe they won&rsquo;t suck, but we'd better see objective proof of them having an impact on actually shipping things on the large.</span></p></li><li><p><em><span>&ldquo;Well, maybe it kind of sucks now, but if you don&rsquo;t adopt it early, you&rsquo;ll be left behind.&rdquo;</span><br></em><span>There are no indicators that prompting is hard to learn. Github Copilot themselves say that </span><a href="https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/">initially, users only accept 29% of prompted coding suggestions</a><span> (which itself is a wild claim to inefficiency, why would you publicize that?), but with six months of experience, users naturally get better at prompting and that grows to a whopping 34% acceptance rate. Apparently, 6 months of experience only makes you 5% better at prompting.</span></p></li><li><p><em>&ldquo;Well, maybe quality is going up and things aren&rsquo;t necessarily shipping faster&hellip;&rdquo;</em><br><span>That doesn&rsquo;t make any sense. We all know that the industry has taken a step back in terms of code quality by at least a decade. Hardly anyone tests anymore. The last time I heard the phrase &ldquo;continuous improvement&rdquo; or &ldquo;test-driven development&rdquo; was before COVID. You know as well as I do that if there&rsquo;s a tool that can make people 10x coders, we&rsquo;d be drowning in shovelware.</span></p></li><li><p><em>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s all website-driven, and people don&rsquo;t really care about domain names these days; it&rsquo;s all subdomains on sites like Vercel.&rdquo;</em><br><span>Shut up. People love their ego domains.</span></p></li><li><p><em>&ldquo;Well, .ai domain names are up 47% this year&hellip;&rdquo;</em><br><span>Yeah, that&rsquo;s cause all the startups pivoted to AI. It&rsquo;s the only way to get money out of investor FOMO. Has the overall amount of domain names gone up at an unprecedented rate, though? No, it hasn&rsquo;t. Look at the new domains chart.</span></p></li><li><p><em>&ldquo;Well, if you were a real engineer, you&rsquo;d know that most of software development is not writing code.&rdquo;</em><br><span>That&rsquo;s only true when you&rsquo;re in a large corporation. When you&rsquo;re by yourself, when you&rsquo;re the stakeholder as well as the developer, you&rsquo;re not in meetings. You're telling me that people aren&rsquo;t shipping anything solo anymore? That people aren&rsquo;t shipping new GitHub projects that scratch a personal itch? How does software creation not involve code?</span></p></li></ol></div></article></div><div><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div><div class="gallery"><p><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!DPg1!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F53c83842-05e1-4ca1-9021-c292e8f3a502_600x371.png"></p><p><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!eBmO!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4e23e3e0-d046-4b58-ab6d-bb8e78d38493_664x415.png"></p></div></section>]]></description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2025 05:55:29 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://github.com/microsoft/BASIC-M6502</link><title>Microsoft Releases Historic 6502 Basic (github.com)</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1n7luaa/microsoft_releases_historic_6502_basic/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1n7luaa/microsoft_releases_historic_6502_basic/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p>Reading time: 7 min | <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1n7luaa/microsoft_releases_historic_6502_basic/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='preview-image'><img src='https://opengraph.githubassets.com/747936cb27384ea220469f6b29a2d8bae02dc427f0c68a8c4ebdd992df83c04b/microsoft/BASIC-M6502' /></section><section class='parsed-content'><div><article><h2>Microsoft BASIC for 6502 Microprocessor - Version 1.1</h2><a href="https://github.com#microsoft-basic-for-6502-microprocessor---version-11"></a><p></p><h2>Historical Significance</h2><a href="https://github.com#historical-significance"></a><p>This assembly language source code represents one of the most historically significant pieces of software from the early personal computer era.

The thing with payment transactions is that you are supposed to process each transaction (e.g. send money from John's account to Jane) exactly once. It's 3 AM, your PagerDuty is blowing up with alerts about transactions being processed multiple times by cron jobs, and you're staring at Redis locks that <em>should</em> prevent this exact problem. Sound familiar?</p><p>We didn't end up sending money to someone 20 times, but our problem was similar. This is the story of how we went from a complex Redis-based locking nightmare to a beautifully simple database-centric solution, and why you should probably ditch those distributed locks too.</p><h2>The Great Redis Lock Disaster of 2025</h2><p>Let me set the scene. We have this automated testing platform where developers would push their OpenAPI specs, and our job workers would generate tests in the background. Think Postman, but the test generation is automated. Simple enough, right? Wrong.</p><p>The system worked like this:</p><ul> <li>Developer pushes an OpenAPI spec with 50 endpoints to our platform</li> <li>We create 50 "pending" test generation tasks in the database</li> <li>Multiple job instances fight over who gets to process what</li> <li>Chaos ensues, developers get duplicate test suites</li> </ul><p>Our "brilliant" solution was Redis user-level locking:</p><div><pre><span>def</span><span>main</span><span>():</span> <span>redis</span> <span>=</span> <span>redis_client</span><span>()</span> <span># Get users with pending tasks</span> <span>users_with_pending_tasks</span> <span>=</span> <span>get_users_with_pending_tasks</span><span>()</span> <span># Try to acquire lock for a user </span> <span>for</span> <span>user</span> <span>in</span> <span>users_with_pending_tasks</span><span>:</span> <span>user_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>user</span><span>[</span><span>"user_id"</span><span>]</span> <span>lock_acquired</span> <span>=</span> <span>redis</span><span>.</span><span>setnx</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>"process_lock_</span><span>{</span><span>user_id</span><span>}</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>user_id</span><span>)</span> <span>if</span> <span>lock_acquired</span><span>:</span> <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>"Acquired lock for user </span><span>{</span><span>user_id</span><span>}</span><span>"</span><span>)</span> <span>process_user_tasks</span><span>(</span><span>user_id</span><span>)</span> <span>redis</span><span>.</span><span>delete</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>"process_lock_</span><span>{</span><span>user_id</span><span>}</span><span>"</span><span>)</span> <span># Release lock</span> <span>break</span> </pre></div><p>This looked solid on paper. One job per user, clean separation, what could go wrong?</p><p>Turns out, a lot. Here's what we discovered after days of debugging.</p><h3>The Ghost Lock Problem</h3><p>Jobs would crash (because who writes perfect code?), leaving behind zombie locks in Redis. Developer #12345's tasks would be forever locked, waiting for a job that no longer exists. We'd have to manually clean these up, which is about as fun as debugging CSS alignment issues.</p><h3>The Race Condition Ballet</h3><p>Even worse, we had this beautiful race condition where two jobs would:</p><ol> <li>Both check if a developer has pending tasks &#10003;</li> <li>Both try to acquire the same user's lock</li> <li>One succeeds, one fails, but...</li> <li>The winner sometimes processed tasks that were already being handled</li> </ol><p>It was like watching two developers simultaneously fix the same bug in different branches.</p><h3>The "It Should Work" Syndrome</h3><p>The most frustrating part? The logic was sound. User-level locking <em>should</em> prevent duplicate processing. But we were still getting duplicate test suites generated, and developers were opening GitHub issues faster than we could close them.</p><p>After staring at this code for the hundredth time, my teammate dropped this gem: "Why are we even using Redis for this? Isn't our database already designed to handle concurrency?"</p><h2>The Database Epiphany</h2><p>They were right. Here we were, adding this complex external dependency when PostgreSQL has been solving concurrency problems since before Redis was even a twinkle in antirez's eye.</p><p>The solution was embarrassingly simple:</p><div><pre><span>def</span><span>claim_task</span><span>(</span><span>task_id</span><span>):</span> <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>execute_query</span><span>(</span> <span>"UPDATE tasks SET status = 'processing' WHERE id = </span><span>%s</span><span> AND status = 'pending'"</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>task_id</span><span>,)</span> <span>)</span> <span>return</span> <span>result</span><span>.</span><span>rowcount</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span># True if we successfully claimed it</span> </pre></div><p>That's it. Twelve lines of Redis complexity replaced by three lines of SQL.</p><h3>Why This Actually Works</h3><p>When two jobs try to claim the same task simultaneously:</p><ol> <li><strong>Job A</strong> executes the UPDATE first (we're talking microseconds here)</li> <li><strong>Job B</strong> executes the UPDATE immediately after</li> <li>Job A finds <code>status = 'pending'</code>, updates it to 'processing', returns <code>rowcount = 1</code></li> <li>Job B finds <code>status = 'processing'</code> (not 'pending'), updates nothing, returns <code>rowcount = 0</code></li> </ol><p>The database engine handles all the locking, isolation, and consistency for us. It's literally what ACID properties were designed for.</p><h2>The New Approach: Beautifully Boring</h2><p>Here's what our main processing loop became:</p><div><pre><span>def</span><span>main</span><span>():</span> <span># Get all pending tasks - dead simple</span> <span>pending_tasks</span> <span>=</span> <span>get_tasks_by_status</span><span>(</span><span>"pending"</span><span>)</span> <span>for</span> <span>task</span> <span>in</span> <span>pending_tasks</span><span>:</span> <span># Try to atomically claim this task</span> <span>if</span> <span>claim_task</span><span>(</span><span>task</span><span>[</span><span>"id"</span><span>]):</span> <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>"Got task </span><span>{</span><span>task</span><span>[</span><span>'id'</span><span>]</span><span>}</span><span>, let's go!"</span><span>)</span> <span>process_task</span><span>(</span><span>task</span><span>)</span> <span>else</span><span>:</span> <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>"Task </span><span>{</span><span>task</span><span>[</span><span>'id'</span><span>]</span><span>}</span><span> stolen by another worker, moving on..."</span><span>)</span> <span>def</span><span>claim_task</span><span>(</span><span>task_id</span><span>):</span> <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>execute_query</span><span>(</span> <span>"UPDATE tasks SET status = 'processing' WHERE id = </span><span>%s</span><span> AND status = 'pending'"</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>task_id</span><span>,)</span> <span>)</span> <span>return</span> <span>result</span><span>.</span><span>rowcount</span> <span>&gt;</span> </pre></div><p>No Redis calls. No lock cleanup. No timeouts. No complex error handling. Just pure, boring database operations.</p><h2>Enter the Resource Hog Problem</h2><p>But wait, there's more! (There's always more, isn't there?)</p><p>Our celebration was short-lived. Within a week, we discovered a new problem: one startup uploaded their monolithic API spec with 1,000 endpoints (yes, we've all been there). Guess what happened? All our job instances started fighting over that user's tasks, completely ignoring everyone else.</p><p>Meanwhile, Sarah uploaded her simple microservice spec with 3 endpoints and watched it sit in the queue for hours while MegaCorp's monolith hogged all the workers. Classic tragedy of the commons.</p><p>This is where the simplicity of our solution became both a blessing and a curse. It was too fair - treating all tasks equally regardless of user impact.</p><h2>The Fairness Fix: Not All Users Are Created Equal</h2><p>We went with the simplest solution first: limit each user to 2 concurrent test generation tasks max.</p><div><pre><span></span><span>def</span><span>main</span><span>():</span> <span>pending_tasks</span> <span>=</span> <span>get_tasks_by_status</span><span>(</span><span>"pending"</span><span>)</span> <span>for</span> <span>task</span> <span>in</span> <span>pending_tasks</span><span>:</span> <span># Check if this user is already hogging resources</span> <span>user_task_count</span> <span>=</span> <span>get_user_task_count</span><span>(</span><span>task</span><span>[</span><span>"user_id"</span><span>],</span> <span>"processing"</span><span>)</span> <span>if</span> <span>user_task_count</span> <span>&gt;=</span> <span>2</span><span>:</span> <span># Max 2 concurrent tasks per user</span> <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>"User </span><span>{</span><span>task</span><span>[</span><span>'user_id'</span><span>]</span><span>}</span><span> hit their limit, skipping..."</span><span>)</span> <span>continue</span> <span># Try to claim the task</span> <span>if</span> <span>claim_task</span><span>(</span><span>task</span><span>[</span><span>"id"</span><span>]):</span> <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>"Processing task for user </span><span>{</span><span>task</span><span>[</span><span>'user_id'</span><span>]</span><span>}</span><span>"</span><span>)</span> <span>process_task</span><span>(</span><span>task</span><span>)</span> <span>def</span><span>get_user_task_count</span><span>(</span><span>user_id</span><span>,</span> <span>status</span><span>):</span> <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>execute_query</span><span>(</span> <span>"SELECT COUNT(*) as count FROM tasks WHERE user_id = </span><span>%s</span><span> AND status = </span><span>%s</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>user_id</span><span>,</span> <span>status</span><span>)</span> <span>)</span> <span>return</span> <span>result</span><span>[</span><span>"count"</span><span>]</span> </pre></div><p>Simple, effective, and Sarah is happy again.</p><h2>There Are A Few Other Ways To Solve This</h2><h3>The Single-Query Approach: For the SQL Wizards</h3><p>If you want to be fancy (and reduce database calls), you can do the fairness check and task claiming in one atomic operation:</p><div><pre><span>def</span><span>claim_task_with_fairness</span><span>(</span><span>task_id</span><span>,</span> <span>max_concurrent</span><span>=</span><span>2</span><span>):</span> <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>execute_query</span><span>(</span><span>"""</span> <span> UPDATE tasks t1 </span> <span> SET status = 'processing' </span> <span> WHERE t1.id = </span><span>%s</span><span> AND t1.status = 'pending'</span> <span> AND (</span> <span> SELECT COUNT(*) </span> <span> FROM tasks t2 </span> <span> WHERE t2.user_id = t1.user_id </span> <span> AND t2.status = 'processing'</span> <span> ) &lt; </span><span>%s</span> <span> """</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>task_id</span><span>,</span> <span>max_concurrent</span><span>))</span> <span>return</span> <span>result</span><span>.</span><span>rowcount</span> <span>&gt;</span> </pre></div><p>This is beautiful from a database perspective - one query does it all. But it's harder to debug when things go wrong, and trust me, things will go wrong.</p><h3>The Round-Robin Approach: Maximum Fairness</h3><p>For maximum fairness, you can prioritize users who have fewer tasks running:</p><div><pre><span></span><span>def</span><span>get_fair_pending_tasks</span><span>():</span> <span>"""Get tasks ordered by user fairness - users with fewer running tasks go first"""</span> <span>return</span> <span>execute_query</span><span>(</span><span>"""</span> <span> SELECT t1.* FROM tasks t1</span> <span> LEFT JOIN (</span> <span> SELECT user_id, COUNT(*) as running_count</span> <span> FROM tasks </span> <span> WHERE status = 'processing'</span> <span> GROUP BY user_id</span> <span> ) t2 ON t1.user_id = t2.user_id</span> <span> WHERE t1.status = 'pending'</span> <span> ORDER BY COALESCE(t2.running_count, 0) ASC, t1.created_at ASC</span> <span> """</span><span>)</span> </pre></div><p>This query is doing some heavy lifting:</p><ol> <li>Get all pending tasks</li> <li>Count how many tasks each user has running</li> <li>Order by fewest running tasks first, then by creation time</li> </ol><p>It's more complex but gives you true round-robin fairness. MegaCorp's monolith still gets processed, but not at Sarah's microservice's expense.</p><h3>The Time-Based Approach: "When Did I Last Process This User?"</h3><p>You could also add a <code>last_processed_at</code> timestamp to users and prioritize those who haven't been processed recently. But honestly, that's probably overkill unless you're running something like GitHub Actions at scale.</p><h2>The Lessons I Wish I'd Learned Sooner</h2><h3>1. Your Database Is Smarter Than You Think</h3><p>I spent weeks building a distributed locking system when PostgreSQL was sitting there like "I've literally been doing this since 1996, but okay..."</p><p>Databases are <em>designed</em> for concurrency. ACID properties exist for exactly these scenarios. Use them.</p><h3>2. Complexity Is a Bug, Not a Feature</h3><p>Every line of Redis locking code was a potential failure point:</p><ul> <li>Network timeouts</li> <li>Lock cleanup failures</li> <li>Race conditions between services</li> <li>Memory management in Redis</li> </ul><p>The database solution eliminated all of this. Sometimes the best code is the code you don't write.</p><h3>3. Fairness Isn't Optional in Multi-Tenant Systems</h3><p>We learned this the hard way when MegaCorp's monolith starved all the microservice users. If you're building anything where multiple users compete for resources, think about fairness from day one, not when your users start filing angry GitHub issues.</p><h3>4. Start Simple, Then Optimize</h3><p>We went with the two-query approach (check user count, then claim task) rather than the fancy single-query version. Why? Because when something breaks at 3 AM, you want to be able to debug it quickly.</p><h2>Performance Reality Check</h2><p>Let's be honest about the trade-offs:</p><p><strong>Database Approach:</strong></p><ul> <li>&#9989; No Redis memory usage</li> <li>&#9989; Leverages existing database infrastructure</li> <li>&#9989; ACID guarantees</li> <li>&#10060; Extra SELECT query for fairness checks</li> <li>&#10060; Slightly higher database load</li> </ul><p><strong>Redis Approach:</strong></p><ul> <li>&#9989; Fast in-memory operations</li> <li>&#9989; Dedicated locking primitives</li> <li>&#10060; Additional infrastructure to maintain</li> <li>&#10060; Network calls can fail</li> <li>&#10060; Lock cleanup complexity</li> <li>&#10060; Memory management</li> </ul><p>For our use case, the database approach was clearly better. Your mileage may vary.</p><h2>When To Use Each Approach</h2><p><strong>Go with database atomicity when:</strong></p><ul> <li>Your tasks live in the database anyway</li> <li>You want strong consistency guarantees</li> <li>You're trying to reduce infrastructure complexity</li> <li>You trust your database more than your distributed systems skills (smart choice)</li> </ul><p><strong>Stick with Redis/distributed locks when:</strong></p><ul> <li>You need locks across multiple databases</li> <li>Tasks involve complex multi-step operations</li> <li>You already have Redis infrastructure you're comfortable with</li> <li>You're building something like a workflow engine with complex state</li> </ul> <h2>The Bottom Line</h2><p>We replaced 50 lines of complex Redis locking logic with 5 lines of SQL and immediately solved our duplicate processing problem. Sometimes the best engineering solution is the boring one.</p><p>Your database has been solving concurrency problems longer than most of us have been writing code. Maybe it's time to trust it.</p><hr> </div></section>]]></description><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 22:28:12 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://kyo.iroiro.party/en/posts/why-rewriting-emacs-is-hard/</link><title>Why Rewriting Emacs Is Hard (kyo.iroiro.party)</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1n7j5wr/why_rewriting_emacs_is_hard/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1n7j5wr/why_rewriting_emacs_is_hard/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p>Reading time: 25 min | <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1n7j5wr/why_rewriting_emacs_is_hard/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='separator separator-before-parsed-content'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='parsed-content'><div><nav><h2>Table of Contents<a href="https://kyo.iroiro.party#table-of-contents" title="Permalink to this heading">&para;</a></h2><div><ul> <li> <a href="https://kyo.iroiro.party#rolling-your-own-string-types">1.

The same applies to most other languages/libraries whose string types are aware of Unicode: the string type has no place for invalid Unicode characters, rightfully so, because it was designed (or re-designed) with only Unicode in mind. </p><p>However, Emacs Lisp, as a language dedicated to a text editor, decides to reserve space for even invalid bytes. Trying to construct a string containing a single <code>#x3FFFFF</code> code point in Emacs, and you will see that it is treated as a single raw byte <code>\377</code> (or <code>#xFF</code>) - the code point range <code>#x3FFF80 - #x3FFFFF</code> is for representing raw bytes: </p><div><pre><code><span>(</span><span>string</span><span>#x3FFF80</span><span>#x3FFFFF</span><span>)</span> </code></pre></div><pre>"\200\377" </pre><p>This is how Emacs ensures lossless file editing. Regardless of the encoding, it transforms invalid bytes into &ldquo;raw bytes&rdquo; that both the ELisp runtime and encoders recognize. When saving, these raw bytes are preserved exactly as they were. </p><blockquote><p>Actually many C-based editors may have similar properties: unedited bytes are preserved as is because a string is just a sequence of bytes. But I am afraid their scripting language, if any, may not be prepared for this. </p></blockquote> </div></div><div><h3> <span>1.2.</span> More universal than Unicode<a href="https://kyo.iroiro.party#more-universal-than-unicode" title="Permalink to this heading">&para;</a></h3><div><p>Another reason for the <code>0 - #x3FFFFF</code> character range is that Emacs was born before Unicode, and, quite luckily, has been one of the few apps that <i>do not</i> just wrongly assume that Unicode has been actually universal. </p><p>Before Unicode, there were a lot of encodings for various languages in various territories. While many of them have now been incorporated into Unicode and can map the code points back and forth, some of them are yet to be fully mapped. An example is the tibetan <span>ISO</span>-2022 encoding, and you may see for yourself at <a href="https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/lisp/language/tibetan.el"><code>tibetan.el</code></a> (where Emacs defines its lossless tibetan coding system) for how many of the characters are only representable by replacement characters. <sup><a href="https://kyo.iroiro.party#fn.tibetan">5</a></sup></p><p>The Emacs&rsquo; solution to this is similar to that of invalid bytes: Emacs reserves code point space (<code>#x110000 - #x3FFF7F</code>) for characters that are not yet unified (meaning, not yet mapped to Unicode), and any ELisp programs may simply treat them as normal characters, with all text operations still applicable. </p><blockquote><p>Personally I still wonder how these un-unified characters are to be displayed. On my Emacs setup they are just tofu blocks with hexadecimal codes on top, and I don&rsquo;t have a clue whether there are any fonts for them. It seems the look-up tables in many font formats nowadays also assume Unicode code points (or at least searching in English tells me that). So maybe one will need special font formats/terminals for that? </p></blockquote> </div></div></div><div><h2> <span>2.</span> Bringing your own string libraries<a href="https://kyo.iroiro.party#bringing-your-own-string-libraries" title="Permalink to this heading">&para;</a></h2><p>If you are to roll your own string types, then you definitely will need to re-implement all those string libraries. Even if you decide to ignore all that and just use the language&rsquo;s built-in Unicode strings for everything, you will still need to brace yourself for most of the string primitives. No, you cannot simply wrap around your favorite regexp/string libraries, and here is why. </p><div><h3> <span>2.1.</span> Case tables<a href="https://kyo.iroiro.party#case-tables" title="Permalink to this heading">&para;</a></h3><div><p>Most languages provide ways to convert a string to its uppercase/lowercase, and most of them use look-up tables under the hood because of the vast number of conversions and irregularities of Unicode case conversions. Emacs does this too, except that it fully exposes those look-up tables as mutable to ELisp code (although some of them are only accessible through <code>unicode-property-table-internal</code>). The result of this is that one can use <code>upcase/downcase</code> for arbitrary string transformations, in addition to Unicode case conversions.

Unfortunately, the regexp in Emacs is too specialized to be compatible with any other regexp implementations, <a href="https://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp1.html">backtracking or not</a>. The following is a regexp example I took from <code>cc-fonts.el</code> (font lock support for <span>CC</span> Mode (a mode for C/C++)): </p><div><pre><code><span>"\\(\\=\\|\\(\\=\\|[^\\]\\)[\n\r]\\)"</span><span>; noncontinued-line-end</span> </code></pre></div><p>No, it is not the extraneous backslashes that makes it incompatible. For people that prefer &ldquo;normal&rdquo; regexp syntax, here it is: <code>(\=|(\=|[^\\])[\n\r])</code>, with <code>\=</code> basically meaning &ldquo;where the user cursor is&rdquo;, and the regexp just means &ldquo;let&rsquo;s treat <code><backslash> and then <end_of_line></end_of_line></backslash></code> or <code><user_cursor> and then <end_of_line></end_of_line></user_cursor></code> as a non-continued line end. Simple, right? Only if the common regexp libraries support asserting <code><user_cursor></user_cursor></code>. </p><p>And it&rsquo;s more than that. Of course Emacs regexps will use case tables for <code>[:lower:]</code>, <code>[:upper:]</code> or case-insensitive matching via <code>case-fold-search</code>. And unsurprisingly, the same applies to the word assertion <code>\w</code>, word boundary assertion <code>\b</code> and more, which involve syntax tables and maybe char category tables. All these also make a slowish backtracking regexp engine mandatory (although one may offload simple regexps to a non-backtracking one). </p><blockquote><p>Emacs allows ELisp to attach <code>syntax-table</code> properties to specific texts in buffers or strings, thus overriding &ldquo;what the syntax table says about this particular character&rdquo;. It seems mainly used with subroutines for parsing, like <code>parse-partial-sexp</code>, but thank goodness it does not affect regexp matching.

All of this wrapped inside the labyrinth of tickets, planning meetings, and agile rituals.</p><p>These processes, meant to drive quality, often slow us down more than the act of writing code itself because they require thought, shared understanding, and sound judgment.</p><p>Now, with LLMs making it easy to generate working code faster than ever, a new narrative has emerged: that writing code <em>was</em> the bottleneck, and we&rsquo;ve finally cracked it.</p><p>But that&rsquo;s <strong>not quite right</strong>.</p><p>The marginal cost of adding new software is approaching <strong>zero</strong>, especially with LLMs. But what is the price of <em>understanding</em>, <em>testing</em>, and <em>trusting</em> that code? <strong>Higher than ever</strong>.</p><hr> <h2>LLMs shift the workload &mdash; they don&rsquo;t remove it</h2><p>Tools like Claude can speed up initial implementation. Still, the result is often more code flowing through systems and more pressure on the people responsible for reviewing, integrating, and maintaining it.</p><p>This becomes especially clear when:</p><ul> <li>It&rsquo;s unclear whether the author fully understands what they submitted.</li> <li>The generated code introduces unfamiliar patterns or breaks established conventions.</li> <li>Edge cases and unintended side effects aren&rsquo;t obvious.</li> </ul><p>We end up in a situation where code is more straightforward to produce but more complex to verify, which doesn&rsquo;t necessarily make teams move faster overall.</p><p>It&rsquo;s not a new challenge. Developers have long joked about <strong>&ldquo;copy-paste engineering&rdquo;</strong>, but the velocity and scale that LLMs enable have <strong>amplified those copy-paste habits</strong>.</p><hr> <h2>Understanding code is still the hard part</h2> <blockquote><p><em>&ldquo;The biggest cost of code is understanding it &mdash; not writing it.&rdquo;</em></p></blockquote><p>LLMs reduce the time it takes to produce code, but they haven&rsquo;t changed the amount of effort required to reason about behavior, identify subtle bugs, or ensure long-term maintainability. That work can be even more challenging when reviewers struggle to distinguish between generated and handwritten code or understand why a particular solution was chosen.</p><hr> <h2>Teams still rely on trust and shared context</h2><p>Software engineering has always been collaborative. It depends on <strong>shared understanding</strong>, <strong>alignment</strong>, and <strong>mentoring</strong>. However, when code is generated faster than it can be discussed or reviewed, teams risk falling into a mode where <strong>quality is assumed rather than ensured</strong>. That creates stress on reviewers and mentors, potentially slowing things down in more subtle ways.</p><hr> <h2>LLMs are powerful &mdash; but they don&rsquo;t fix the fundamentals</h2><p>There&rsquo;s real value in faster prototyping, scaffolding, and automation. But LLMs don&rsquo;t remove the need for <strong>clear thinking</strong>, <strong>careful review</strong>, and <strong>thoughtful design</strong>. If anything, those become even more important as more code gets generated.</p><p>Yes, the cost of writing code has indeed dropped. But the cost of making sense of it together as a team <strong>hasn&rsquo;t</strong>.</p><p><strong>That&rsquo;s still the bottleneck. Let&rsquo;s not pretend it isn&rsquo;t.</strong></p></div></section>]]></description><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 20:03:25 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://blog.frost.kiwi/dual-kawase/</link><title>Video Game Blurs (and how the best one works) (blog.frost.kiwi)</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1n7c780/video_game_blurs_and_how_the_best_one_works/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1n7c780/video_game_blurs_and_how_the_best_one_works/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p>Reading time: 347 min | <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1n7c780/video_game_blurs_and_how_the_best_one_works/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='separator separator-before-parsed-content'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='parsed-content'><div><p>Blurs are the basic building block for many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_post-processing#Uses_in_3D_rendering">video game post-processing effects</a> and essential for sleek and modern <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface">GUIs</a>.

happening. Above the box you have an <code>Animate</code> button, which will move the scene around to tease out problems of upcoming algorithms. Movement happens <strong>before</strong> our blur will be applied, akin to the player character moving. To see our blur in different use-cases, there are 3 modes:</p><blockquote><p>Different blur algorithms behave differently based on use-case. Some are very performance efficient, but break under movement. Some reveal their flaws with small, high contrast regions like far-away lights</p><img src="https://blog.frost.kiwi/assets/kiwis/teach.svg"></blockquote><ul><li>In <code>Scene</code> mode the blur will be applied across the whole image</li><li>In <code>Lights</code> mode we see and blur just the <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/render/shader_nodes/shader/principled.html#emission">Emission</a> parts of the scene, sometimes called &ldquo;<a href="https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Glowing_textures_(Source)#$selfillum">Self-Illumination</a>&rdquo;<ul><li>This also unlocks the <code>lightBrightness</code> slider, where you can boost the energy output of the lights</li></ul></li><li>In <code>Bloom</code> mode, we use the original scene and add the blurred lights from the previous mode on top to create a moody scene. This implements the effect of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_(shader_effect)">Bloom</a>, an important use-case for blurs in real-time 3D graphics</li></ul><blockquote><p>Adding the blurred emission <a href="https://chrismillervfx.wordpress.com/2013/04/15/understanding-render-passes/">pass</a> as we do in this article, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thresholding_(image_processing)">thresholding</a> the scene and blurring that, is <strong>not</strong> actually how modern video games do bloom. We'll get into that a bit later.</p><img src="https://blog.frost.kiwi/assets/kiwis/detective.svg"></blockquote><p>Finally, you see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_resolution">Resolution</a> of the canvas and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_rate">Frames per Second / time taken per frame, aka &ldquo;frametime&rdquo;</a>.

In a nut-shell, a fragment shader is code that runs on the GPU for every output-pixel, in-parallel. Image inputs in shaders are called <a href="https://learnopengl.com/Getting-started/Textures">Textures</a>. These textures have coordinates, often called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UV_mapping">UV coordinates</a> - <em>these</em> are the numbers we care about.</p><blockquote><p>Technically, fragment shaders run per <a href="https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Fragment">fragment</a>, which aren't necessarily pixel sized and there are <a href="https://registry.khronos.org/OpenGL/extensions/EXT/EXT_shader_framebuffer_fetch.txt">other ways</a> to read framebuffers, but none of that matters in the context of this article.</p><img src="https://blog.frost.kiwi/assets/kiwis/detective.svg"></blockquote><figure><img src="https://blog.frost.kiwiimg/UV.svg" alt="Texture coordinates, also called UV Coordinates or UVs for short"><figcaption>Texture coordinates, also called "UV" Coordinates or "UVs" for short<br>Note the squished appearance of the image</figcaption></figure><p>UV coordinates specify the position we read in the image, with bottom left being <code>0,0</code> and the top right being <code>1,1</code>. Neither UV coordinates, nor shaders themselves have any concept of image resolution, screen resolution or aspect ratio. If we want to address individual pixels, it&rsquo;s on us to express that in terms of UV coordinates.</p><blockquote><div><p>Although <a href="https://michaldrobot.com/2014/04/01/gcn-execution-patterns-in-full-screen-passes/">there are ways to find out</a>, we don't know which order output-pixels are processed in, and although the <a href="https://docs.gl/sl4/gl_FragCoord">graphics pipeline can tell us</a>, the shader doesn't even know which output-pixel it currently processes</p></div><img src="https://blog.frost.kiwi/assets/kiwis/book.svg"></blockquote><p>The framebuffer is passed into the fragment shader in line <code>uniform sampler2D texture</code> as a texture. Using the blur shader, we draw a &ldquo;Full Screen Quad&rdquo;, a rectangle covering the entire canvas, with matching <code>0,0</code> in the bottom-left and <code>1,1</code> in the top-right <code>varying vec2 uv</code> UV coordinates to read from the texture.</p><p>The texture&rsquo;s aspect-ratio and resolution are the same as the output canvas&rsquo;s aspect-ratio and resolution, thus there is a 1:1 pixel mapping between the texture we will process and our output canvas. The <a href="https://github.com/FrostKiwi/treasurechest/blob/main/posts/dual-kawase/js/blur/simple.js">graphics pipeline steps</a> and <a href="https://github.com/FrostKiwi/treasurechest/blob/main/posts/dual-kawase/shader/simpleQuad.vs">vertex shader</a> responsible for this are not important for this article.</p><p>The blur fragment shader accesses the color of the texture with <code>texture2D(texture, uv)</code>, at the matching output pixel&rsquo;s position. In following examples, we&rsquo;ll read from neighboring pixels, for which we&rsquo;ll need to calculate a UV coordinate offset, a decimal fraction corresponding to one pixel step, calculated with with <code>1 / canvasResolution</code></p><blockquote><p>One way to think of fragment shader code is "What are the instructions to construct this output pixel?"</p><img src="https://blog.frost.kiwi/assets/kiwis/think.svg"></blockquote><p>Graphics programming is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJQ0qXh1-m0">uniquely challenging</a> in the beginning, because of how many rules and limitations the hardware, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_library">graphics APIs</a> and the <a href="https://fgiesen.wordpress.com/2011/07/09/a-trip-through-the-graphics-pipeline-2011-index/">rendering pipeline</a> impose. But it also unlocks incredible potential, as other limitations dissolve. Let&rsquo;s find out how graphics programmers have leveraged that potential.</p><h2>Box Blur <a href="https://blog.frost.kiwi#box-blur">#</a></h2><p>From a programmer&rsquo;s perspective, the most straight forward way is to average the neighbors of a pixel using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_loop">for-loop</a>. What the fragment shader is expressing is: &ldquo;<em>look Y pixels up &amp; down, X pixels left &amp; right and average the colors</em>&rdquo;. The more we want to blur, the more we have to increase <code>kernelSize</code>, the bounds of our for-loop.</p><pre><code><span>/* Read from the texture y amount of pixels above and below */</span> <span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>int</span> y <span>=</span> <span>-</span>kernel_size<span>;</span> y <span>&lt;=</span> kernel_size<span>;</span> <span>++</span>y<span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>/* Read from the texture x amount of pixels to the left and the right */</span> <span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>int</span> x <span>=</span> <span>-</span>kernel_size<span>;</span> x <span>&lt;=</span> kernel_size<span>;</span> <span>++</span>x<span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>/* Offset from current pixel, indicating which pixel to read */</span> <span>vec2</span> offset <span>=</span> <span>vec2</span><span>(</span>x<span>,</span> y<span>)</span> <span>*</span> samplePosMult <span>*</span> frameSizeRCP<span>;</span> <span>/* Read and sum up the color contribution of that pixel */</span> sum <span>+=</span> <span>texture2D</span><span>(</span>texture<span>,</span> uv <span>+</span> offset<span>)</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span> <span>}</span></code></pre><p>The bigger the for-loop, the more texture reads we perform, <strong>per output-pixel</strong>. Each texture read is often called a &ldquo;texture tap&rdquo; and the total amount of those &ldquo;taps&rdquo; per-frame will now also be displayed. New controls, new <code>samplePosMultiplier</code>, new terms - Play around with them, get a feel for them, with a constant eye on FPS.</p><div><div><p><label> Scene</label> <label> Lights</label> <label> Bloom</label></p><p><label> Animate</label></p></div><div><canvas></canvas><p>&#10060; The browser killed this WebGL Context, please reload the page.

The stronger the blur, the more &ldquo;boxy&rdquo; features of the image become. This is due to us reading and averaging the texture in a square shape. Especially in bloom mode, with strong <code>lightBrightness</code> and big <code>kernelSize</code>, lights become literally squares.</p><p>Performance is also really bad. With bigger <code>kernelSizes</code>, our <code>Texture Taps</code> count skyrockets and performance drops. Mobile devices will come to a slog. Even the worlds fastest PC graphics cards will fall below screen refresh-rate by cranking <code>kernelSize</code> and zooming the article on PC, thus raising canvas resolution.</p><blockquote><p>We kinda failed on all fronts. It looks bad <strong>and</strong> runs bad.</p><img src="https://blog.frost.kiwi/assets/kiwis/facepalm.svg"></blockquote><p>Then, there&rsquo;s this <code>samplePosMultiplier</code>. It seems to <em>also</em> seemingly increase blur strength, <em>without</em> increasing textureTaps or lowering performance (or lowering performance just a little on certain devices). But if we crank <em>that</em> too much, we get artifacts in the form of repeating patterns. Let&rsquo;s play with a schematic example:</p><ul><li>The white center square represents the output pixel</li><li>Grey squares are the pixels we would read, with the current <code>kernelSize</code>, with <code>samplePosMult</code> untouched</li><li>the black dots are our <em>actual</em> texture reads <em><strong>per-output-pixel</strong></em>, our &ldquo;sample&rdquo; positions</li></ul><div><table><tr><td><code>kernelSize</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>kernelSize</code></td><td></td><td><output>3&times;3</output></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><code>samplePosMult</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>samplePosMult</code></td><td></td><td><output>100</output>%</td><td></td></tr></table></div><p>On can say, that an image is a &ldquo;continous 2D signal&rdquo;. When we texture tap at a specific coordinate, we are <em>sampling the &ldquo;image signal&rdquo; at that coordinate</em>. As previously mentioned, we use UV coordinates and are not bound by concepts like &ldquo;pixels position&rdquo;. <em><strong>Where</strong></em> we place our samples is completely up to us.</p><p>A fundamental blur algorithm option is increasing the sample distance away from the center, thus increasing the amount of image we cover with our samples - more bang for your sample buck. This works by multiplying the offset distance. That is what <code>samplePosMult</code> does and is something you will have access to going forward.</p><p>Doing it too much, brings ugly repeating patterns. This of course leaves some fundamental questions, like where these artifacts come from and what it even means to read between two pixels. <em><strong>And</strong></em> on top of that we have to address performance and the boxyness of our blur! But first&hellip;</p><h2>What even <em>is</em> a kernel? <a href="https://blog.frost.kiwi#what-even-is-a-kernel%3F">#</a></h2><p>What we have created with our for-loop, is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuXjwB4LzSA0">convolution</a>. Very simplified, in the context of image processing, it&rsquo;s usually a square of numbers constructing an output pixel, by gathering and weighting pixels, that the square covers. The square is called a kernel and was the thing we visualized previously.</p><p>For blurs, the kernel weights must sum up to 1. If that were not the case, we would either brighten or darken the image. Ensuring that is the normalization step. In the box blur above, this happens by dividing the summed pixel color by <code>totalSamples</code>, the total amount of samples taken. A basic &ldquo;calculate the average&rdquo; expression.</p><p>The same can be expressed as weights of a kernel, a number multiplied with each sample at that position. Since the box blur weighs all sample the same regardless of position, all weights are the same. This is visualized next. The bigger the kernel size, the smaller the weights.</p><div><svg></svg><table><tr><td><code>kernelSize</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>kernelSize</code></td><td></td><td><output>3&times;3</output></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><code>samplePosMult</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>samplePosMult</code></td><td></td><td><output>100</output>%</td><td></td></tr></table></div><p>Kernels applied at the edges of our image will read from areas &ldquo;outside&rdquo; the image, with UV coordinates smaller than <code>0,0</code> and bigger than <code>1,1</code>. Luckily, the GPU handles this for us and we are free to decide what happens to those outside samples, by setting the <a href="https://learnopengl.com/Getting-started/Textures#:~:text=Texture%20Wrapping">Texture Wrapping mode</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.frost.kiwiimg/WrappingModes.png" alt="Texture Wrapping Modes and results on blurring"><figcaption>Texture Wrapping Modes and results on blurring (Note the color black bleeding-in)<br><strong>Top</strong>: Framebuffer, zoomed out. <strong>Bottom</strong>: Framebuffer normal, with strong blur applied</figcaption></figure><p>Among others, we can define a solid color to be used, or to &ldquo;clamp&rdquo; to the nearest edge&rsquo;s color. If we choose a solid color, then we will get color bleeding at the edges. Thus for almost all post-processing use-cases, edge color clamping is used, as it prevents weird things happening at the edges. <a href="https://github.com/FrostKiwi/treasurechest/blob/main/posts/dual-kawase/js/utility.js#L49">This article does too</a>.</p><blockquote><p>You may have noticed a black "blob" streaking with stronger blur levels along the bottom. Specifically here, it happens because the lines between the floor tiles align with the bottom edge, extending black color to infinity</p><img src="https://blog.frost.kiwi/assets/kiwis/detective.svg"></blockquote><p>Convolution as a mathematical concept is surprisingly deep and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@3blue1brown">3blue1brown</a> has an excellent video on it, that even covers the image processing topic. Theoretically, we won&rsquo;t depart from convolutions. We <em><strong>can</strong></em> dissect our code and express it as weights and kernels. With the for-loop box blur, that <em><strong>was</strong></em> quite easy!</p><figure><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KuXjwB4LzSA" title="YouTube video player" width="100%"></iframe><figcaption>But what is a convolution?<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuXjwB4LzSA">YouTube Video</a> by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@3blue1brown">3Blue1Brown</a></figcaption></figure><p>On a practical level though, understanding where the convolution is, how many there are and what kernels are at play will become more and more difficult, once we leave the realm of classical blurs and consider the wider implications of reading between pixel bounds. But for now, we stay with the classics:</p><h2>Gaussian Blur <a href="https://blog.frost.kiwi#gaussian-blur">#</a></h2><p>The most famous of blur algorithms is the Gaussian Blur. It uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution">normal distribution</a>, also known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution">bell Curve</a> to weight the samples inside the kernel, with a new variable <code>sigma &sigma;</code> to control the flatness of the curve. Other than generating the kernel weights, the algorithm is identical to the box blur algorithm.</p><figure><figcaption>Gaussian blur weights formula for point <code>(x,y)</code> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_blur#Mathematics">(Source)</a></figcaption></figure><p>To calculate the weights for point <code>(x,y)</code>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_blur#Mathematics">above formula is used</a>. The gaussian formula has a weighting multiplier <code>1/&radic;(2&pi;&sigma;&sup2;)</code>. In the code, there is no such thing though. The formula expresses the gaussian curve as a <em>continuous</em> function going to <em>infinity</em>. But our code and its for-loop are different - <em><strong>discrete</strong></em> and <em><strong>finite</strong></em>.</p><pre><code><span>float</span> <span>gaussianWeight</span><span>(</span><span>float</span> x<span>,</span> <span>float</span> y<span>,</span> <span>float</span> sigma<span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>/* (x&sup2; + y&sup2;) / 2 &sigma;&sup2; */</span> <span>return</span> <span>exp</span><span>(</span><span>-</span><span>(</span>x <span>*</span> x <span>+</span> y <span>*</span> y<span>)</span> <span>/</span> <span>(</span><span>2.0</span> <span>*</span> sigma <span>*</span> sigma<span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span></code></pre><blockquote><p>For clarity, the kernel is generated in the fragment shader. Normally, that should be avoided. Fragment shaders run per-output-pixel, but the kernel weights stay the same, making this inefficient.</p><img src="https://blog.frost.kiwi/assets/kiwis/teach.svg"></blockquote><p>Just like with the box blur, weights are summed up and divided at the end, instead of the term <code>1/&radic;(2&pi;&sigma;&sup2;)</code> precalculating weights. <code>sigma</code> controls the sharpness of the curve and thus the blur strength, but wasn&rsquo;t that the job of <code>kernelSize</code>? Play around with all the values below and get a feel for how the various values behave.</p><div><div><p><label> Scene</label> <label> Lights</label> <label> Bloom</label></p><p><label> Animate</label></p></div><div><canvas></canvas><p>&#10060; The browser killed this WebGL Context, please reload the page.

with things generally taking on a &ldquo;rounder&rdquo; appearance, due to the bell curve&rsquo;s smooth signal response. That is, unless you move the <code>sigma</code> slider down. If you move <code>sigma</code> too low, you will get our previous box blur like artifacts again.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s clear up what the values actually represent and how they interact. The following visualization shows the kernel with its weights expressed as height in an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isometric_projection"><s>Isometric</s></a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axonometric_projection#Three_types">Dimetric</a> perspective projection. There are two different interaction modes with <code>sigma</code> when changing <code>kernelSize</code> and two ways to express <code>sigma</code>.</p><div><p><label> Absolute Sigma</label> <label> Relative Sigma</label></p><table><tr><td><code>kernelSize</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>kernelSize</code></td><td></td><td><output>7&times;7</output></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><code>sigma</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>sigma</code></td><td> </td><td><span><span>&plusmn;<output>3.00</output>&sigma; </span><span><output>1.00</output>px</span></span></td><td></td></tr></table></div><p><code>sigma</code> describes the flatness of our mathematical curve, a curve going to infinity. But our algorithm has a limited <code>kernelSize</code>. Where the kernel stops, no more pixel contributions occur, leading to box-blur-like artifacts due to the cut-off. In the context of image processing, there are two ways to setup a gaussian blur&hellip;</p><blockquote><p>A small sigma, thus a flat bell curve, paired with a small kernel size effectively <strong>is</strong> a box blur, with the weights making the kernel box-shaped.</p><img src="https://blog.frost.kiwi/assets/kiwis/think.svg"></blockquote><p>&hellip; way 1: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueNY30Cs8Lk">Absolute Sigma</a>. <code>sigma</code> is an absolute value in pixels independent of <code>kernelSize</code>, with <code>kernelSize</code> acting as a &ldquo;window into the curve&rdquo; or way 2: <code>sigma</code> is expressed <em><strong>relative</strong></em> to the current <code>kernelSize</code>. For practical reasons (finicky sliders) the relative to <code>kernelSize</code> mode is used everywhere.</p><p>Eitherway, the infinite gaussian curve <em><strong>will</strong></em> have a cut-off <em>somewhere</em>. <code>sigma</code> too small? - We get box blur like artifacts. <code>sigma</code> too big? - We waste blur efficiency, as the same perceived blur strength requires bigger kernels, thus bigger for-loops with lower performance. An artistic trade-off every piece of software has to make.</p><blockquote><p>An optimal kernel would be one, where the outer weights are almost zero. Thus, if we increased <code>kernelSize</code> in Absolute Sigma mode by one, it would make close to no more <strong>visual</strong> difference.</p><img src="https://blog.frost.kiwi/assets/kiwis/teach.svg"></blockquote><p>There are other ways of creating blur kernels, with other properties. One way is to follow <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_triangle">Pascal&rsquo;s triangle</a> to get a set of predefined kernel sizes and weights. These are called <a href="https://bartwronski.com/2021/10/31/practical-gaussian-filter-binomial-filter-and-small-sigma-gaussians/">Binomial Filters</a> and lock us into specific &ldquo;kernel presets&rdquo;, but solve the infinity vs cut-off dilemma, by moving weights to zero within the sampling window.</p><p>Binomial Kernels are also Gaussian-like in their frequency response. We won&rsquo;t expand on these further, just know that we <em><strong>can</strong></em> choose kernels by different mathematical criteria, chasing different signal response characteristics. But speaking of which, what even <em>is</em> Gaussian Like? Why do we care?</p><h3>What is Gaussian-like? <a href="https://blog.frost.kiwi#what-is-gaussian-like%3F">#</a></h3><p>In Post-Processing Blur algorithms you generally find two categories. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bokeh">Bokeh</a> Blurs and Gaussian-Like Blurs. The gaussian is chosen for its natural appearance, its ability to smooth colors without &ldquo;standout features&rdquo;. Gaussian Blurs are generally used as an ingredient in an overarching visual effect, be it frosted glass Interfaces or Bloom.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.frost.kiwiimg/gaussianLike.png" alt="Bokeh blur, gaussian blur comparison"><figcaption>Bokeh Blur and Gaussian Blur compared.</figcaption></figure><p>In contrast to that, when emulating lenses and or creating <a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/depth-of-field-in-unreal-engine">Depth of Field</a>, is &ldquo;<a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/cinematic-depth-of-field-method?application_version=4.27">Bokeh Blur</a>&rdquo; - also known as &ldquo;Lens Blur&rdquo; or &ldquo;Cinematic Blur&rdquo;. This type of blur <em><strong>is</strong></em> the target visual effect. The challenges and approaches are very much related, but algorithms used differ.</p><p>Algorithms get really creative in this space, all with different trade-offs and visuals. Some sample using a <a href="https://mynameismjp.wordpress.com/2011/02/28/bokeh/">poission disk distribution</a> and some have cool out of the box thinking: Computerphile covered a comlex numbers based approach to creating Bokeh Blurs, a fascinating number theory cross-over.</p><figure><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vNG3ZAd8wCc" title="YouTube video player" width="100%"></iframe><figcaption>Video Game &amp; Complex Bokeh Blurs<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNG3ZAd8wCc">YouTube Video</a> by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Computerphile">Computerphile</a></figcaption></figure><p>This article though doesn&rsquo;t care about these stylistics approaches. We are here to chase a basic building block of graphics programming and realtime visual effects, a &ldquo;Gaussian-Like&rdquo; with good performance. Speaking of which!</p><h2>Performance <a href="https://blog.frost.kiwi#performance">#</a></h2><p>The main motivator of our journey here, is the chase of realtime performance. Everything we do must happen within few milliseconds. The expected performance of an algorithm and the practical cost once placed in the graphics pipeline, are sometimes surprisingly different numbers though. Gotta measure!</p><blockquote><p>This chapter is about a very <strong>technical</strong> motivation. If you don't care about how fast a GPU does what it does, feel free to skip this section.</p><img src="https://blog.frost.kiwi/assets/kiwis/happy.svg"></blockquote><p>With performance being such a driving motivator, it would be a shame if we couldn&rsquo;t measure it in this article. Each WebGL Box has a benchmark function, which blurs random noise at a fixed resolution of <code>1600x1200</code> with the respective blur settings you chose and a fixed iteration count workload, a feature hidden so far.</p><blockquote><p>Realtime graphics programming is sometimes more about measuring than programming.</p><img src="https://blog.frost.kiwi/assets/kiwis/laugh.svg"></blockquote><p>Benchmarking is best done by measuring shader execution time. This <a href="https://registry.khronos.org/webgl/extensions/EXT_disjoint_timer_query_webgl2/">can be done</a> in the browser reliably, but only on some platforms. No way exists to do so across all platforms. Luckily, there is the classic method of &ldquo;stalling the graphics pipeline&rdquo;, forcing a wait until all commands finish, a moment in time we can measure.</p><blockquote><p>Across all platforms a stall is guaranteed to occur on command <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGLRenderingContext/readPixels"><code>gl.readPixels()</code></a>. Interestingly, the standards conform command for this: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGLRenderingContext/finish"><code>gl.finish()</code></a> is simply ignored by mobile apple devices.</p><img src="https://blog.frost.kiwi/assets/kiwis/book.svg"></blockquote><p>Below is a button, that unlocks this benchmarking feature, unhiding a benchmark button and <code>Detailed Benchmark Results</code> section under each blur. This allows you to start a benchmark with a preset workload, on a separate <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers">Browser Worker</a>. There is only one issue: Browsers get <em><strong>very</strong></em> angry if you full-load the GPU this way.</p><p>If the graphics pipeline is doing work without reporting back (called &ldquo;yielding&rdquo;) to the browser for too long, browsers will simply kill all GPU access for the whole page, until tab reload. If we yield back, then the measured results are useless and from inside WebGL, we can&rsquo;t stop the GPU, once its commands are issued.</p><blockquote>&#9888;&#65039; Especially on mobile: <strong>please</strong> increase <code>kernelSize</code> and iterations slowly. The previous algorithms have bad <code>kernelSize</code> performance scaling on purpose, be especially careful with them.<p>Stay below <strong>2</strong> seconds of execution time, or the browser will lock GPU access for the page, disabling all blur examples, until a browser restart is performed. On iOS Safari this requires a trip to the App Switcher, a page reload won't be enough.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>iOS and iPad OS are <strong>especially</strong> strict, will keep GPU access disabled, even on Tab Reload. You will have go to the App Switcher (Double Tap Home Button), Swipe Safari Up to close it and relaunch it from scratch.</p><img src="https://blog.frost.kiwi/assets/kiwis/miffed.svg"></blockquote><h3>What are we optimizing for? <a href="https://blog.frost.kiwi#what-are-we-optimizing-for%3F">#</a></h3><p>With the <a href="https://blog.frost.kiwi#box-blur">above Box Blur</a> and <a href="https://blog.frost.kiwi#gaussian-blur">above Gaussian Blur</a>, you will measure performance scaling very badly with <code>kernelSize</code>. Expressed in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation">Big O notation</a>, it has a performance scaling of <code>O(pixelCount * kernelSize&sup2;)</code>. Quadratic scaling of required texture taps in terms of <code>kernelSize</code>. We need to tackle this going forward.</p><blockquote><p>Especially dedicated Laptop GPUs are slow to get out of their lower power states. Pressing the benchmark button multiple times in a row may result in the performance numbers getting better.</p><img src="https://blog.frost.kiwi/assets/kiwis/detective.svg"></blockquote><p>Despite the gaussian blur calculating the kernel <a href="https://github.com/FrostKiwi/treasurechest/blob/main/posts/dual-kawase/shader/gaussianBlur.fs#L18">completely from scratch on every single pixel in our implementation</a>, the performance of the box blur and gaussian blur are very close to each other at higher iteration counts. In fact, by precalculating the those kernels we could performance match both.</p><blockquote><p>But isn't gaussian blur a more complicated algorithm?</p><img src="https://blog.frost.kiwi/assets/kiwis/think.svg"></blockquote><p>As opposed to chips from decades ago, modern graphics cards have very fast arithmetic, but comparatively slow memory access times. With workloads like these, the slowest thing becomes the memory access, in our case the texture taps. The more taps, the slower the algorithm.</p><blockquote><p>Our blurs perform a <strong>dependant texture read</strong>, a graphics programming sin. This is when texture coordinates are determined <strong>during</strong> shader execution, which opts out of a many automated shader optimizations.</p><img src="https://blog.frost.kiwi/assets/kiwis/teach.svg"></blockquote><p>Especially on personal computers, you may also have noticed that increasing <code>samplePosMultiplier</code> will negatively impact performance (up to a point), even though the required texture taps stay the same.</p><p>This is due hardware texture caches accelerating texture reads which are spatially close together and not being able to do so effectively, if the texture reads are all too far apart. Platform dependant tools like <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/identifying-shader-limiters-with-the-shader-profiler-in-nvidia-nsight-graphics/">Nvidia NSight</a> can measure GPU cache utilization. The browser cannot.</p><p>These are key numbers graphics programmers chase when writing fragment shaders: <strong>Texture Taps</strong> and <strong>Cache Utilization</strong>. There is another one, we will get into in a moment. Clearly, our Blurs are <em><strong>slow</strong></em>. Time for a speed up!</p><h2>Separable Gaussian Blur <a href="https://blog.frost.kiwi#separable-gaussian-blur">#</a></h2><p>We have not yet left the <em>classics</em> of blur algorithms. One fundamental concept left on the table is &ldquo;convolution separability&rdquo;. Certain Convolutions like our <a href="https://blog.frost.kiwi#box-blur">Box Blur</a>, <a href="https://blog.frost.kiwi#gaussian-blur">our Gaussian Blur</a> and the <a href="https://bartwronski.com/2021/10/31/practical-gaussian-filter-binomial-filter-and-small-sigma-gaussians/">Binominal filtering</a> mentioned in passing previously can all be performed in two separate passes, by two <em><strong>separate</strong></em> 1D Kernels.</p><figure><svg height="10rem" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"></svg> <figcaption>Gaussian blur weights formula for, separated</figcaption></figure><p>Not all convolutions are separable. In the context of graphics programming: If you can express the kernel weights as a formula with axes <code>X, Y</code> and factor-out both <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code> into two separate formulas, then you have gained separability of a 2D kernel and can perform the convolution in two passes, massively saving on texture taps.</p><blockquote><p>Some big budget video games have used effects with kernels that are <strong>not</strong> separable, but did it anyway in two passes + 1D Kernel for the performance gain, with the resulting artifacts being deemed not too bad.</p><img src="https://blog.frost.kiwi/assets/kiwis/detective.svg"></blockquote><p>Computerphile covered the concept of separability in the context of 2D image processing really well, if you are interested in a more formal explanation.</p><figure><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SiJpkucGa1o" title="YouTube video player" width="100%"></iframe><figcaption>Separable Filters and a Bauble<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiJpkucGa1o">YouTube Video</a> by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Computerphile">Computerphile</a></figcaption></figure><p>Here is our Gaussian Blur, but expressed as a separable Version.

But there <em>is</em> a trade-off made, that&rsquo;s not quite obvious. In order to have two passes, we are writing out a new framebuffer. Remember the &ldquo;modern chips are fast but memory access in relation is not&rdquo; thing?</p><p>With a modern High-res 4k screen video game, multi-pass anything implies writing out 8.2 Million Pixels to memory, just to read them back in. With smaller kernels on high-res displays, a separable kernel may not always be faster. But with bigger kernels, it almost always is. With a massive speed-up gained, how much faster can we go?</p><h2>The magic of frequency space <a href="https://blog.frost.kiwi#the-magic-of-frequency-space">#</a></h2><p>&hellip;how about blurs that happen so fast, that they are considered free! We are doing a bit of a detour into <em><strong>Frequency Space</strong></em> image manipulation.</p><p>Any 2D image can be converted and edited in frequency space, which unlocks a whole new sort of image manipulation. To blur an image in this paradigm, we perform an <a href="https://usage.imagemagick.org/fourier/#introduction">image Fast Fourier Transform</a>, then <a href="https://usage.imagemagick.org/fourier/#blurring">mask high frequency areas to perform the blur</a> and finally do the inverse transformation.</p><p>A Fourier Transform decomposes a signal into its underlying Sine Frequencies. The output of an <em>image Fast Fourier Transform</em> are &ldquo;Magnitude&rdquo; and &ldquo;Phase&rdquo; component images. These images can be combined back together with the inverse image FFT to produce the original image again&hellip;</p><figure><img src="https://blog.frost.kiwiimg/256ScreenOverlay.png" alt="FFT Viz Input image"><figcaption>Input image for the following interactive FFT example<br>The green stripes are not an error, they are baked into the image on purpose.</figcaption></figure><p>&hellip;but before doing so, we can manipulate the frequency representation of the image in various ways. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHvdLwSZmF8">Less reading, more interaction!</a> In the following interactive visualization you have the magnitude image, brightness boosted into a human visible representation on the left and the reconstructed image on the right.</p><p>For now, play around with removing energy. You can paint on the magnitude image with your fingers or with the mouse. The output image will be reconstructed accordingly. Also, play around with the circular mask and the feathering sliders. Try to build intuition for what&rsquo;s happening.</p><div><div><p><label><p>Upload <span>Image</span></p></label></p><p><label> Remove<span>Frequency Energy</span></label> <label> Add<span>Frequency Energy</span></label></p><p><label> Reset<span>Magnitude</span></label></p></div><table><tr><td><code>frequencyCutRadius</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>frequencyCutRadius</code></td><td></td><td><output>off</output></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><code>feather</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>feather</code></td><td></td><td><output>0</output></td><td></td></tr></table></div><p>The magnitude image represents the frequency make-up of the image, with the lowest frequencies in the middle and higher at the edges. Horizontal frequencies (vertical features in the image) follow the X Axis and vertical frequencies (Horizontal features in the image) follow the Y Axis, with in-betweens being the diagonals.</p><p>Repeating patterns in the image lighten up as bright-points in the magnitude representation. Or rather, their frequencies have high energy: E.g. the green grid I added. Removing it in photoshop wouldn&rsquo;t be easy! But in frequency space it <em><strong>is</strong></em> easy! Just paint over the blueish 3 diagonal streaks.</p><blockquote><p>Removing repeating features by finger-painting black over frequencies still blows me away.</p><img src="https://blog.frost.kiwi/assets/kiwis/surprised.svg"></blockquote><p>As you may have noticed, the Magnitude representation holds mirrored information. This is due to the FFT being a complex number analysis and our image having only &ldquo;real&rdquo; component pixels, leaving redundant information. The underlying number theory was covered in great detail by 3Blue1Brown:</p><figure><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/spUNpyF58BY" title="YouTube video player" width="100%"></iframe><figcaption>But what is the Fourier Transform? A visual introduction.<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spUNpyF58BY">YouTube Video</a> by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@3blue1brown">3Blue1Brown</a></figcaption></figure><p>The underlying code this time is not written by me, but is from <a href="https://github.com/turbomaze/">@turbomaze</a>&rsquo;s repo <a href="https://github.com/turbomaze/JS-Fourier-Image-Analysis">JS-Fourier-Image-Analysis</a>. There is no standard on how you are supposed to plot the magnitude information and how the quadrants are layed out. I changed the implementation by <a href="https://github.com/turbomaze/">@turbomaze</a> to follow the <a href="https://usage.imagemagick.org/fourier/#introduction">convention used by ImageMagick</a>.</p><p>We can blur the image by painting the frequency energy black in a radius around the center, thus eliminating higher frequencies and blurring the image. If we do so with a pixel perfect circle, then we get ringing artifacts - The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibbs_phenomenon">Gibbs phenomenon</a>. By feathering the circle, we lessen this ringing and the blur cleans up.</p><blockquote><p>Drawing a circle like this? That's essentially free on the GPU! We get the equivalent of get super big kernels for free!</p><img src="https://blog.frost.kiwi/assets/kiwis/party.svg"></blockquote><p>But not everything is gold that glitters. First of all, performance. Yes, the &ldquo;blur&rdquo; in frequency space is essentially free, but the trip to frequency space, is everything but. The main issue comes down to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_diagram">FFT transformations</a> performing writes to exponentially many pixels per input pixel, a performance killer.</p><blockquote><p><strong>And</strong> then there's still the inverse conversion!</p><img src="https://blog.frost.kiwi/assets/kiwis/facepalm.svg"></blockquote><p>But our shaders work the other way around, expressing the &ldquo;instructions to construct an output pixel&rdquo;. There <em>are</em> <a href="https://github.com/rreusser/glsl-fft">fragment shader based GPU implementations</a>, but they rely on many passes for calculation, a lot of memory access back and forth. Furthermore, non-power of two images <a href="https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/rocFFT/en/latest/design/bluestein.html">require a slower algorithm</a>.</p><p>This article is in the realm of fragment shaders and the graphics pipeline a GPU is part of, but there are also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_computing_on_graphics_processing_units">GPGPU</a> and <a href="https://github.com/bane9/OpenGLFFT">compute shader implementations</a> with no fragment shader specific limitations. Unfortunately the situation remains: Conversion of high-res images to frequency space is too costly in the context of realtime graphics.</p><blockquote><p>Deleting the frequencies of that grid is magical, but leaves artifacts. In reality it's worse, as my example is idealized. Click <strong>Upload Image</strong>, take a photo of a repeating pattern and see how cleanly you can get rid of it.</p><img src="https://blog.frost.kiwi/assets/kiwis/detective.svg"></blockquote><p>Then there are the artifacts I have glossed over. The FFT transformation considers the image as an infinite 2D signal. By blurring, we are bleeding through color from the neighbor copies. And that&rsquo;s not to mention various ringing artifacts that happen. <em><strong>None</strong></em> of this is unsolvable! But there a more underlying issue&hellip;</p><h3>What is a Low-Pass filter? <a href="https://blog.frost.kiwi#what-is-a-low-pass-filter%3F">#</a></h3><blockquote><p>It's a filter that removes high frequencies and leaves the low ones, easy!</p><img src="https://blog.frost.kiwi/assets/kiwis/happy.svg"></blockquote><p>Try the FFT Example again and decrease the <code>frequencyCutRadius</code> to blur. At some point the green lines disappear, right? It <em><strong>is</strong></em> a low pass filter, one where high frequencies are literally annihilated. Small bright lights in the distance? Also annihilated&hellip;</p><div><div><p><label><p>Upload <span>Image</span></p><svg><path></path></svg></label></p><p><label> Remove<span>Frequency Energy</span></label> <label> Add<span>Frequency Energy</span></label></p><p><label> Reset<span>Magnitude</span></label></p></div><table><tr><td><code>frequencyCutRadius</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>frequencyCutRadius</code></td><td></td><td><output>off</output></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><code>feather</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>feather</code></td><td></td><td><output>0</output></td><td></td></tr></table></div><p>If we were to use this to build an effect like bloom, it would remove small lights that are meant to bloom as well! Our gaussian blur on the other hand, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_blur#Low-pass_filter">also a low-pass filter</a>, samples and weights <em><strong>every</strong></em> pixel. In a way it &ldquo;<em>takes the high frequency energy and spreads it into low frequency energy</em>&rdquo;.</p><p>So Low Pass Filter &ne; Low Pass Filter, it depends on context as to what is meant by that word and the reason the article didn&rsquo;t use it until now. Frequency Space energy attenuations are simply not the correct tool for our goal of a &ldquo;basic graphics programming building block&rdquo; for visual effects.</p><blockquote><p>This is a <strong>deep misunderstanding</strong> I held for year, as in why <strong>didn't</strong> video games such a powerful tool?<output></output></p><img src="https://blog.frost.kiwi/assets/kiwis/speak.svg"></blockquote><p>There are other frequency space image representations, not just FFT Magnitude + Phase. Another famous one is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_cosine_transform">Discrete cosine transform</a>. Again, computerphile covered it in great detail in a video. As for realtime hires images, no. DCT conversion is multiple magnitudes slower. Feel free to dive deeper into frequency space&hellip;</p><figure><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Q2aEzeMDHMA" title="YouTube video player" width="100%"></iframe><figcaption>JPEG DCT, Discrete Cosine Transform (JPEG Pt2)<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2aEzeMDHMA">YouTube Video</a> by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Computerphile">Computerphile</a></figcaption></figure><p>&hellip;as for this article, it&rsquo;s the end of our frequency space detour. We talked so much about what&rsquo;s slow on the GPU. Let&rsquo;s talk about something that&rsquo;s not just fast, but free:</p><h2>Bilinear Interpolation <a href="https://blog.frost.kiwi#bilinear-interpolation">#</a></h2><p>Reading from textures comes with a freebie. When reading between pixels, the closet four pixel are interpolated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilinear_interpolation">bilinearly</a> to create the final read, unless you switch to <a href="https://learnopengl.com/Getting-started/Textures#:~:text=Texture%20Filtering">Nearest Neightbor mode</a>. Below you can drag the color sample with finger touch or the mouse. Take note of how and when the color changes in the respective modes.</p><div><div><p><label> Nearest Neighbor</label> <label> Bilinear</label></p><p><label> Animate</label></p></div></div><p>Since reading between pixels gets a linear mix of pixel neighbors, we can <a href="https://www.rastergrid.com/blog/2010/09/efficient-gaussian-blur-with-linear-sampling/">linearly interpolate part of our gaussian kernel</a>, sometimes called a <a href="https://www.rastergrid.com/blog/2010/09/efficient-gaussian-blur-with-linear-sampling/">Linear Gaussian</a>. By tweaking gaussian weights and reducing the amount of samples we could do a 7 &times; 7 gaussian kernel worth of information with only a 4 &times; 4 kernel, as shown in the <a href="https://www.rastergrid.com/blog/2010/09/efficient-gaussian-blur-with-linear-sampling/">linked article</a>.</p><blockquote><p>Though mathematically not the same, visually the result is very close. There are a lot of hand-crafted variations on this, different mixes of kernel sizes and interpolation amounts.</p><img src="https://blog.frost.kiwi/assets/kiwis/speak.svg"></blockquote><p>Bilinear interpolation allows us to resize an image by reading from it at lower resolution. In a way, it&rsquo;s a free bilinear resize built into every graphics chip, zero performance impact. But there <em>is</em> a limit - the bilinear interpolation is limited to a 2 &times; 2 sample square. Try to resize the kiwi below in different modes.</p><blockquote><p>To make this more obvious, the following canvas renders at 25% of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1:1_pixel_mapping">native resolution</a>.</p><img src="https://blog.frost.kiwi/assets/kiwis/teach.svg"></blockquote><div><div><p><label> Nearest Neighbor</label> <label> Bilinear</label></p><p><label> Animate</label></p></div><div><canvas></canvas><p>&#10060; The browser killed this WebGL Context, please reload the page.

100% size, which is equivalent to 1:1 pixel mapping. At 100% it moves &ldquo;jittery&rdquo;, as it &ldquo;snaps&rdquo; to the nearest neighbor. Bilinear keeps things smooth, but going below 50%, especially below 25%, we get exactly the same kind of aliasing, as we would get from nearest neighbor!</p><blockquote><p>You may have noticed similar aliasing when playing YouTube Videos at a very high manually selected video resolution, but in a small window. Same thing!</p><img src="https://blog.frost.kiwi/assets/kiwis/detective.svg"></blockquote><p>With 2 &times; 2 samples, we start skipping over color information, if the underlying pixels are smaller than half a pixel in size. Below 50% size, our bilinear interpolation starts to act like nearest neighbor interpolation. So as a result, we can shrink image in steps of 50%, without &ldquo;skipping over information&rdquo; and creating aliasing. Let&rsquo;s use that!</p><h2>Downsampling <a href="https://blog.frost.kiwi#downsampling">#</a></h2><p>One fundamental thing thing you can do in post-processing is to shrink &ldquo;downsample&rdquo; first, perform the processing at a lower resolution and upsample again. With the idea being, that you wouldn&rsquo;t notice the lowered resolution. Below is the <a href="https://blog.frost.kiwi#separable-gaussian-blur">Separable Gaussian Blur</a> again, with a variable downsample / upsample chain.</p><p>Each increase of <code>downSample</code> adds a 50% scale step. Let&rsquo;s visualize the framebuffers in play, as it gets quite complex. Here is an example of a square 1024 px&sup2; image, a <code>downSample</code> of <code>2</code> and our two pass separable Gaussian blur.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.frost.kiwiimg/framebuffer.svg" alt="Downsample and Blur Framebuffers"><figcaption>Framebuffers and their sizes, as used during the downsample + blur chain</figcaption></figure><blockquote><p>One unused optimization is that the blur can read straight from the 512 px&sup2; framebuffer and output the 256 px&sup2; directly, skipping one downsample step.</p><img src="https://blog.frost.kiwi/assets/kiwis/detective.svg"></blockquote><p>Below you have the option to skip part of the downsample or part of the upsample chain, if you have <code>downSample</code> set to higher than 1. What may not be quite obvious is why we also upsample in steps. Play around with all the dials and modes, to get a feel for what&rsquo;s happening.</p><div><div><p><label> Scene</label> <label> Lights</label> <label> Bloom</label></p><p><label> Animate</label></p></div><div><canvas></canvas><p>&#10060; The browser killed this WebGL Context, please reload the page.

more area, thus increasing the blur radius. Performance is again, a massive lift up, as we quadratically get less and less pixels to blur with each step. We get bigger blurs with the same <code>kernelSize</code> and with stronger blurs in <code>Scene</code> mode, the resolution drop is not visible.</p><p>With smaller blurs you will get &ldquo;shimmering&rdquo;, as aliasing artifacts begin, even with our bilinear filtering in place. Small blurs and lower resolution don&rsquo;t mix. This is <em><strong>especially</strong></em> painful in bloom mode with strong <code>lightBrightness</code>, as lights will start to &ldquo;turn on and off&rdquo; as they are not resolved correctly at lower resolutions.</p><blockquote><p>There must be some kind of sweet spot of low resolution and blur strong enough to hide the the low resolution.</p><img src="https://blog.frost.kiwi/assets/kiwis/think.svg"></blockquote><p>Skipping Downsample steps will bring obviously horrible aliasing. As for upsampling, there is a deep misunderstanding I held for years, until I read the SIGGRAPH 2014 presentation <a href="https://www.iryoku.com/next-generation-post-processing-in-call-of-duty-advanced-warfare/">Next Generation Post Processing in Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare</a> by graphics magician <a href="https://www.iryoku.com/">Jorge Jimenez</a>. One page stuck out to me:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.frost.kiwiimg/jimenez2014.png" alt="Page 159 from presentation Next Generation Post Processing in Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare by Jorge Jimenez"><figcaption>Page 159 from presentation <a href="https://www.iryoku.com/next-generation-post-processing-in-call-of-duty-advanced-warfare/">Next Generation Post Processing in Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare</a> by <a href="https://www.iryoku.com/">Jorge Jimenez</a></figcaption></figure><p>With upsampling, even when going from low res to high res in one jump, we aren&rsquo;t &ldquo;skipping&rdquo; any information, right? Nothing is missed. But if you look closely at the above demo with larger <code>downSample</code> chains with <code>Skip Upsample Steps</code> mode, then you will see a vague grid like artifact appearing, especially with strong blurs. <a href="https://blog.frost.kiwi#addendum">This point was expanded in the addendum</a>.</p><figure><figcaption>Visualization of the bilinear interpolation (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicubic_interpolation">Source</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>How to keeps things smooth when upsampling is the field of &ldquo;Reconstruction filters&rdquo;. By skipping intermediate upsampling steps we are performing a 2 &times; 2 sample bilinear reconstruction of very small pixels. As a result we get the bilinear filtering characteristic pyramid shaped hot spots. <em><strong>How</strong></em> we upscale matters.</p><h3>Smooth Blur Animation <a href="https://blog.frost.kiwi#smooth-blur-animation">#</a></h3><p>One fundamental challenge with advanced blur algorithms is that it becomes challenging to get smooth blur sliders and smooth blur strength animations. Eg. with our separable gaussian blur, you could set <code>kernelSize</code> to the maximum required and adjust <code>samplePosMultiplier</code> smoothly between 0% and 100%.</p><p>With downsampling in the picture, this becomes more difficult and solutions to this are very context dependant, so we won&rsquo;t dive into it. One approach you see from time to time is to simply give up on animating blur strength and blend between a blurred and unblurred version of the scene, as shown below. Visually, not very pleasing.</p><h2>Kawase Blur <a href="https://blog.frost.kiwi#kawase-blur">#</a></h2><p>Now we get away from the classical blur approaches. It&rsquo;s the early 2000s and graphics programmer <a href="https://www.siliconstudio.co.jp/middleware/yebis/en/">Masaki Kawase</a>, today senior graphics programmer at Tokyo based company <a href="https://www.siliconstudio.co.jp/">Silicon Studio</a>, is programming the Xbox video game <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjR9VugWoHY">DOUBLE-S.T.E.A.L</a>, a game with vibrant post-processing effects.</p><p>During the creation of those visual effects, <a href="https://www.siliconstudio.co.jp/middleware/yebis/en/">Masaki Kawase</a> used a new blurring technique that he presented in the 2003 Game Developers Conference talk <a href="https://gdcvault.com/browse?keyword=Frame+Buffer+Postprocessing+Effects">Frame Buffer Postprocessing Effects in DOUBLE-S.T.E.A.L (Wreckless)</a>. This technique became later referred to as the &ldquo;Kawase Blur&rdquo;. Let&rsquo;s take a look at it:</p><figure><figcaption>Sample placement in what later become known as the "Kawase Blur"<br>Excerpt from GDC presentation <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060909063116/http://www.daionet.gr.jp/~masa/archives/GDC2003_DSTEAL.ppt">Frame Buffer Postprocessing Effects in DOUBLE-S.T.E.A.L</a> (2003)</figcaption></figure><p>This technique does not have a <code>kernelSize</code> parameter anymore. It works in passes of 4 equally weighted samples, placed diagonally from the center output pixel, in the middle where the corners of 4 pixels touch. These samples get color contributions equally from their neighbors, due to bilinear filtering.</p><blockquote><p>This is new, there is no center pixel sample and, except for the required normalization, no explicit weights! The weighting happens as a result of bilinear filtering.</p><img src="https://blog.frost.kiwi/assets/kiwis/teach.svg"></blockquote><p>After a pass is complete, that pass is used as the input to the next pass, where the outer 4 diagonal samples increase in distance by one pixel length. With each pass, this distance grows. Two framebuffers are required for this, which switch between being input and output between passes. This setup is often called &ldquo;ping-ponging&rdquo;.</p><div><div><p><label> Scene</label> <label> Lights</label> <label> Bloom</label></p><p><label> Animate</label></p></div><div><canvas></canvas><p>L The browser killed this WebGL Context, please reload the page.

href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem">Central Limit Theorem</a> making repeated passes of a box-blur approach a gaussian blur, our Kawase blur provides a smooth gaussian-like results, due to the iterative convolution at play. Technically, there are two convolutions happening at the same time - bilinear filtering and the diagonal samples with increasing distance.</p><blockquote><p>Two different origins: The Gaussian blur came from a mathematical concept entering graphics programming. The Kawase blur was born to get the most out of what hardware provides for free.</p><img src="https://blog.frost.kiwi/assets/kiwis/book.svg"></blockquote><p>It is not a separable convolution, due to its diagonal sampling nature. As no downsampling is used, this means that we write all pixels out to memory, each pass. Even if we could separate, the cost of writing out twice as many passes to memory would outweigh the benefit of going from 4 samples per-pass to 2.</p><blockquote><p>With so few samples, you cannot increase <code>samplePosMultiplier</code> without instantly getting artifacts. We mess up the sample pattern.</p><img src="https://blog.frost.kiwi/assets/kiwis/detective.svg"></blockquote><p>Take note of textures taps: They grow linearly, with increasing blur radius. In DOUBLE-S.T.E.A.L, Masaki Kawase used it to create the bloom effect, calculated at a lower resolution. But there is one more evolution coming up - We have blur, we have downsampling. Two separate concepts. What if we &ldquo;fused&rdquo; them?</p><h2>Dual Kawase Blur <a href="https://blog.frost.kiwi#dual-kawase-blur">#</a></h2><p><a href="https://theorg.com/org/arm/org-chart/marius-bjorge">Marius Bj&oslash;rge</a>, principal graphics architect at <a href="https://www.arm.com/">ARM</a> took this thought to its logical conclusion, when he was optimizing mobile graphics rendering with ARM graphics chips. In a SIGGRAPH 2015 <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2776880.2787664">talk</a> he presented an algorithm, that would later become knows as the &#10024; Dual Kawase Blur &#127775;, this article&rsquo;s final destination.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.frost.kiwiimg/dualKawasePattern.jpg" alt="Dual Kawase sampling patterns"><figcaption>Dual Kawase sampling patterns<br>Excerpt from <a href="https://www.iryoku.com/next-generation-post-processing-in-call-of-duty-advanced-warfare/">Bandwidth-Efficient Rendering</a>, talk by <a href="https://theorg.com/org/arm/org-chart/marius-bjorge">Marius Bj&oslash;rge</a></figcaption></figure><p>This blur works with the idea of Masaki Kawase&rsquo;s &ldquo;placing diagonal samples at increasing distance&rdquo;, but does so in conjunction with downsampling, which effectively performs this &ldquo;increase in distance&rdquo;. There is also a dedicated upsample filter. I&rsquo;ll let Marius Bj&oslash;rge explain this one, an excerpt <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/suppl/10.1145/2776880.2787664/suppl_file/a184.mp4">from his talk mentioned above</a></p><blockquote><strong>Marius Bj&oslash;rge</strong>: For lack for a better name, dual filter is something I come up with when playing with different downsampling and upsampling patterns. It's sort of a derivative of the Kawase filter, but instead of ping-ponging between two equally sized textures, this filter works by having the same filter for down sampling and having another filter for upsampling.<p>The downsample filter works by sampling four pixels covering the target pixel, and you also have four pixels on the corner of this pixel to smudge in some information from all the neighboring pixels. So the end upsample filter works by reconstructing information from the downsample pass. So this pattern was chosen to get a nice smooth circular shape.</p></blockquote><p>Let&rsquo;s try it. This time, there are two blur shaders, as there is an upsample and downsample stage. Again, there is no <code>kernelSize</code>. Instead there are <code>downsampleLevels</code>, which performs the blur in conjunction with the down sampling. Play around with all the slider and get a feel for it.</p><div><div><p><label> Scene</label> <label> Lights</label> <label> Bloom</label></p><p><label> Animate</label></p></div><div><canvas></canvas><p>L The browser killed this WebGL Context, please reload the page.

Remember our first gaussian Blur? Its performance tanked exponentially, as we increased kernel radius. But now, with each downsample step, the required texture taps grow slower and slower. The stronger our blur, the less <em>additional</em> samples we require!</p><p>This was of special interest to Marius Bj&oslash;rge, as his goal was to reduce memory access, which is especially slow on mobile devices, and still produce a motion-stable non shimmering blur. Speaking of which, go into bloom mode, crank <code>lightBrightness</code> and compare it to our <a href="https://blog.frost.kiwi#downsampling">downsample</a> example.</p><p>Even though the resolution is reduced to the same <code>downSample</code> level, no shimmering! That&rsquo;s the Dual Kawase Blur for you - A gaussian-like post-processing blur, with good performance, no heavy repeated memory writes and motion stable output. This makes it ideal as a basic building block for visual effects like bloom.</p><h2>What are the big boys doing? <a href="https://blog.frost.kiwi#what-are-the-big-boys-doing%3F">#</a></h2><p>The Dual Kawase Blur has found its way into game engines and user interfaces alike. For instance the Linux Desktop Environment <a href="https://kde.org/">KDE</a> uses it as the frosted backdrop effect <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220427124712/https://phabricator.kde.org/D9848">since in 2018</a>, where it remains the <a href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma/kwin/-/tree/master/src/plugins/blur">algorithm of choice to this day</a>.

In the middle of the documentary, there&rsquo;s a dramatic segment about how the transition from Python 2 to 3 divided the community (spoiler alert: <a href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/pycharm/2025/08/the-state-of-python-2025/#most-still-use-older-python-versions-despite-benefits-of-newer-releases">it didn&rsquo;t in the end</a>).</p><p>The early versions of Python 3 (3.0-3.4) were mostly focused on stability and offering pathways for users moving from 2.7. Along came 3.5 in 2015 with a new feature: <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0492/"><code>async</code> and <code>await</code> keywords for executing coroutines</a>.</p><p>Ten years and nine releases later, Python 3.14 is <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0745/">weeks away</a>.</p><p>Whilst everyone will be distracted by the shiny, colorful REPL features in 3.14, there are some big announcements nestled in the release notes &mdash; both related to concurrency and parallelism</p><ol> <li><a href="https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#pep-779-free-threaded-python-is-officially-supported">PEP779 Free-Threading is Officially Supported</a>. </li> <li><a href="https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#pep-734-multiple-interpreters-in-the-stdlib">PEP 734: Multiple interpreters in the stdlib</a></li> </ol><p>Both of these features are huge advancements in how Python can be used to execute concurrent code. But if <code>async</code> has been here for 10 years, why do we need them?</p><p>The killer use-case for async is web development. Coroutines lend well to out-of-process network calls, like HTTP requests and database queries. Why block the entire Python interpreter waiting for a SQL query to run on another server?</p><p>Yet, among the three most popular Python web frameworks, async support is still not universal. FastAPI is async from the ground-up, Django has some support, but is <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/topics/async/"><strong>&ldquo;still working on async support&rdquo;</strong></a> in key areas like the ORM (database). Then Flask is and probably always will be synchronous (Quart is an async alternative with similar APIs). The most popular ORM for Python, SQLAlchemy, only added asyncio support in 2023 (<a href="https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/changelog/migration_14.html#change-3414">changelog</a>).</p><p>I posed the question <em>&ldquo;Why isn&rsquo;t async more popular&rdquo;</em> to a couple of other developers to get their thoughts.</p><p><a href="https://realpython.com/team/ctrudeau/">Christopher Trudeau</a>, co-host of the <a href="https://realpython.com/podcasts/rpp/">Real Python Podcast</a>, shared his perspective:</p><blockquote><p>Certain kinds of errors get caught by the compiler, others just disappear. Why didn&rsquo;t that function run? Oops, forgot to await it. Error in the coroutine? Did you remember to launch with the right params, if not, it doesn&rsquo;t percolate up. I still find threads easier to wrap my head around.</p></blockquote><p><a href="https://talkpython.fm/">Michael Kennedy</a> offered some additional insight:</p><blockquote><p>The [GIL] is so omnipresent that most Python people never developed multithreaded/async thinking. Because async/await only works for I/O bound work, not CPU as well, it&rsquo;s of much less use. E.g. You can use in on the web, but most servers fork out to 4-8 web workers anyway</p></blockquote><p>So <strong>what&rsquo;s going on here</strong> and <strong>can we apply the lessons to Free-Threading and Multiple Interpreters in 3.14</strong> so that in another ten years we&rsquo;re looking back and wondering why <strong>they</strong> aren&rsquo;t more popular?</p><h2>Problem 1: What is an asynchronous-shaped problem?<a href="https://tonybaloney.github.io#problem-1-what-is-an-asynchronous-shaped-problem" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2><p><em>Coroutines</em> are most valuable with IO-related tasks. In Python, you can start hundreds of coroutines to make network requests, then wait for them all to finish without running them one at a time. The concepts behind coroutines are quite straightforward. You have a loop (the event loop) and you pass it coroutines to evaluate.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s go back to the classic use-case, HTTP requests:</p><pre><code>def get_thing_sync(): return http_client.get('/thing/which_takes?ages=1') </code></pre><p>The equivalent async function is clean and readable:</p><pre><code>async def get_thing_async(): return await http_client.get('/thing/which_takes?ages=1') </code></pre><p>If you call function <code>get_thing_sync()</code> versus <code>await get_thing_async()</code>, they take <strong>the same amount of time</strong>. Calling it <em>&ldquo;&#10024; asynchronously &#10024;&rdquo;</em> does not somehow make it faster. The gains are when you have more than one coroutine running at once. </p><p>When fetching multiple HTTP resources you can start all the requests at once via the OS network stack, then handle each response as it arrives. The important point is that the actual work &mdash; sending packets and waiting for remote servers &mdash; happens outside your Python process while your code waits. Async is most effective here: you start operations, receive awaitable handles (tasks/futures), and the event loop efficiently notifies the coroutine when each operation completes without wasting CPU on busy&#8209;polling.</p><p>This scenario works well because:</p><ol> <li>The remote end is handling the work in another process</li> <li>The local end (asyncio HTTP library) can yield control while waiting for the response</li> <li>Operating-Systems have stacks and APIs for managing sockets and network</li> </ol><p>That&rsquo;s all fine, but I started with the statement <strong><em>Coroutines</em> are most valuable with IO-related tasks.</strong> I then picked the one task that asyncio can handle really well, HTTP requests.</p><p>What about disk IO? I have <strong>far</strong> more applications in Python which read and write from files on disks or memory than I do making HTTP requests. I also have Python programs which run other programs using <code>subprocess</code>.</p><p>Can I make all of those <code>async</code>? </p><p>No, not really. From the <a href="https://github.com/python/asyncio/wiki/ThirdParty#filesystem">asyncio Wiki</a>:</p><blockquote><p>asyncio does not support asynchronous operations on the filesystem. Even if files are opened with O_NONBLOCK, read and write will block.</p></blockquote><p>The solution is to use a third-party package, <code>aiofiles</code>, which gives you async file I/O capabilities:</p><pre><code>async with aiofiles.open('filename', mode='r') as f: contents = await f.read() </code></pre><p>So, mission accomplished? No because <code>aiofiles</code> uses a <strong>thread pool</strong> to offload the blocking file I/O operations. </p><h3>Side-Quest: Why isn&rsquo;t file IO async?<a href="https://tonybaloney.github.io#side-quest-why-isnt-file-io-async" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3><p>Windows has an async file IO API called <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/ioringapi/">IoRing</a>. Linux has this availability in newer Kernels via <a href="https://kernel.dk/io_uring.pdf"><code>io_uring</code></a>. All I could find for a Python implementation of <code>io_uring</code> is this <a href="https://github.com/YoSTEALTH/Liburing">synchronous API written in Cython</a>.</p><p>There were io_uring APIs for other platforms, Rust has implementations with <a href="https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio-uring">tokio</a>, C++ has <a href="https://think-async.com/Asio/asio-1.24.0/doc/asio/history.html#asio.history.asio_1_21_0">Asio</a> and Node.JS has <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/libuv-io-uring">libuv</a>.</p><p>So, the asyncio Wiki is a little out of date, but</p><ol> <li><strong>Most</strong> production Python applications run on Linux, where the implementation is <code>io_uring</code></li> <li><code>io_uring</code> has been plagued by security issues so bad that RedHat, Google and others have restricted or removed its availability. After paying out $1 million in bug bounties related to <code>io_uring</code>, <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2023/06/learnings-from-kctf-vrps-42-linux.html">Google disabled it on some products</a>. The issue was severe; many of the related bug&#8209;bounty reports involved io_uring exploits.</li> </ol><p>So we should hold our horses a little while longer. Operating Systems have long held a file IO API that handles threads for concurrent IO. It does the job just fine for now.</p><p>So in summary, <em>Coroutines are most valuable with IO-related tasks</em> is only really true for <strong>network I/O</strong> and network sockets in Python were never blocking operations in the first place. Socket open in Python is one of the few operations which releases the GIL and works <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/v3.14.0rc2/Modules/socketmodule.c#L939-L1085">concurrently in a thread pool</a> as a non-blocking operation.</p><h3>Recap: What are the async operations in asyncio?<a href="https://tonybaloney.github.io#recap-what-are-the-async-operations-in-asyncio" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Operation</th> <th>Asyncio API</th> <th>Description</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Sleep</td> <td><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html#asyncio.sleep"><code>asyncio.sleep()</code></a></td> <td>Asynchronously sleep for a given duration.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>TCP/UDP Streams</td> <td><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-stream.html#asyncio-streams"><code>asyncio.open_connection()</code></a></td> <td>Open a TCP/UDP connection.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>HTTP</td> <td><a href="https://docs.aiohttp.org/en/stable/client_reference.html#aiohttp.ClientSession"><code>aiohttp.ClientSession()</code></a></td> <td>Asynchronous HTTP client.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Run Subprocesses</td> <td><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-subprocess.html#asyncio-subprocess"><code>asyncio.subprocess</code></a></td> <td>Asynchronously run subprocesses.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Queues</td> <td><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-queue.html#asyncio-queues"><code>asyncio.Queue</code></a></td> <td>Asynchronous queue implementation.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <h2>Problem 2: No matter how fast you run, you can&rsquo;t escape the GIL<a href="https://tonybaloney.github.io#problem-2-no-matter-how-fast-you-run-you-cant-escape-the-gil" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2><p><a href="https://willmcgugan.github.io/">Will McGugan</a>, the creator of Rich, Textualize, and several other extremely popular Python libraries offered his perspective on async:</p><blockquote><p>I really enjoy async programming, but it isn&rsquo;t intuitive for most devs that don&rsquo;t have a background writing network code. A reoccurring problem I see with Textual is folk testing concurrency by dropping in a <code>time.sleep(10)</code> call to simulate the work they are planning. <strong>Of course, that blocks the entire loop.</strong> But that&rsquo;s a class of issue which is difficult to explain to devs who haven&rsquo;t used async much. i.e. what does it mean for code to &ldquo;block&rdquo;, and when is it necessary to defer to threads. <strong>Without that grounding in the fundamentals, your async code is going to misbehave,</strong> but its not going to break per se. So devs don&rsquo;t get the rapid iteration and feedback that we expect from Python.</p></blockquote><p>Now that we&rsquo;ve covered the limited use cases for async, another challenge keeps coming up. The Python GIL.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve been working on this C#/Python bridge project called <a href="https://tonybaloney.github.io/CSnakes">CSnakes</a>, one of the features that caused the most head-scratching was <a href="https://tonybaloney.github.io/CSnakes/v1/user-guide/async/">async</a>.</p><p>C#, the language from which the <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0492/#why-async-and-await-keywords"><code>async</code>/<code>await</code> syntax was borrowed</a>, has far broader async support in its core I/O libraries because it implements a Task&#8209;based Asynchronous Pattern (TAP), where tasks are dispatched onto a managed thread pool. Disk, network, and memory I/O operations commonly provide both async and sync methods.</p><p>In fact, the C# implementation goes all the way up from the disk to the higher-level APIs, such as serialization libraries. <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.text.json.jsonserializer.deserializeasync?view=net-9.0#system-text-json-jsonserializer-deserializeasync(system-io-stream-system-type-system-text-json-serialization-jsonserializercontext-system-threading-cancellationtoken)">JSON deserialization is async</a>, so is XML. </p><p>The <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/parallel-programming/task-based-asynchronous-programming">C# Async model</a> and the Python Async models have some important differences:</p><ul> <li>C# creates a task pool and tasks are scheduled on this pool. The number of threads is managed automatically by the runtime.</li> <li>Python event loops belong to the thread that created them. C# tasks can be scheduled on any thread.</li> <li>Python async functions are coroutines that are scheduled on the event loop. C# async functions are tasks that are scheduled on the task pool.</li> </ul><p>The benefit of C#&rsquo;s model is that a <code>Task</code> is a higher-level abstraction over a thread or coroutine. This means that you don&rsquo;t have to worry about the underlying thread management, you can schedule several tasks to be awaited concurrently or you can run them in parallel with Task Parallel Library (TPL).</p><p>In Python &ldquo;An event loop runs in a thread (typically the main thread) and executes all callbacks and Tasks in its thread. While a Task is running in the event loop, no other Tasks can run in the same thread. When a Task executes an await expression, the running Task gets suspended, and the event loop executes the next Task.&rdquo; <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-dev.html#asyncio-multithreading">1</a></p><p>Going back to Will&rsquo;s comment <strong>&ldquo;Of course, that blocks the entire loop&rdquo;</strong>, he&rsquo;s talking about operations inside async functions which are blocking and therefore block the entire event loop. Since we covered in Problem 1, that&rsquo;s practically everything except network calls and sleeping. </p><p>With Python&rsquo;s GIL, it doesn&rsquo;t matter if you&rsquo;re running 1 thread or 10, the GIL will lock everything so that only 1 is operating at a time.</p><p>There are some operations don&rsquo;t block the GIL (e.g. File IO) and in those cases you can run them in threads. For example, if you used <code>httpx</code>&lsquo;s streaming feature to stream a large network download onto disk:</p><pre><code>import httpx import tempfile def download_file(url: str): with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(delete=False) as tmp_file: with httpx.stream("GET", url) as response: for chunk in response.iter_bytes(): tmp_file.write(chunk) return tmp_file.name </code></pre><p>Neither the <code>httpx</code> stream iterator nor <code>tmp_file.write</code> is GIL-blocking, so they benefit from running in separate threads.</p><p>We can merge this behavior with an asyncio API, by using the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-eventloop.html#executing-code-in-thread-or-process-pools">Event Loop <code>run_in_executor()</code> function</a> and passing it a thread pool:</p><pre><code>import asyncio import concurrent.futures async def main(): loop = asyncio.get_running_loop() URLS = [ "https://example.place/big-file-1", "https://example.place/big-file-2", "https://example.place/big-file-3", # etc. ] tasks = set() with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=10) as pool: for url in URLS: tasks.add(loop.run_in_executor(pool, download_file, url)) files = await asyncio.gather(*tasks) print(files) </code></pre><p>It&rsquo;s not immediately clear to me what the benefit of this is over running a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html#concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor">thread-pool and calling <code>pool.submit</code></a>. We retain an async API, so if that is important this is an interesting workaround. </p><p>I find that memorizing, documenting, and explaining what is and isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;blocking&rdquo; in Python to be confusing and continually changing.</p><h3>Does the free-threaded mode make asyncio more useful or redundant?<a href="https://tonybaloney.github.io#does-the-free-threaded-mode-make-asyncio-more-useful-or-redundant" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3><p>Python 3.13 introduced a very-unstable &ldquo;free-threaded&rdquo; build of Python where the GIL is removed and replaced with smaller, more granular locks. See my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mp5wKOL4L2Q">PyCon US 2024 Talk</a> for a summary of parallelism. The 3.13 build wasn&rsquo;t stable enough for any production use. 3.14 is looking far improved and I think we can start to introduce free-threading in 2026 in some narrow, well-tested scenarios.</p><p>One major benefit to coroutines versus threads is that they have a far smaller memory footprint, a lower context-switching overhead, and faster startup times. async APIs are also easier to reason about and compose.</p><p>Because parallelism in Python using threads has always been so limited, the APIs in the standard library are quite rudimentary. I think there is an opportunity to have a task-parallelism API in the standard library once free-threading is stabilized. </p><p>Last week I was implementing a registry function that did two discrete tasks. One calls a very slow sync-only API and the other calls several async APIs. </p><p>I want the behavior that:</p><ul> <li>Both are started at the same time</li> <li>If one fails, it cancels the other and raises an exception with the exception details of the failed function</li> <li>The result is only combined when both are complete</li> </ul><pre> flowchart LR Start([Start]) --&gt; Invoke["tpl.invoke()"] Invoke --&gt; f1["f1()"] Invoke --&gt; f2["f2()"] f1 --&gt;|f1 -&gt; T1| Join["Tuple[T1, T2]"] f2 --&gt;|f2 -&gt; T2| Join Join --&gt; End([End]) </pre><p>Since there are only two tasks, I don&rsquo;t want to have to define a thread-pool or a set number of workers. I also don&rsquo;t want to have to map or gather the callees. I want to retain my typing information so that the resulting variables are strongly typed from the return types of <code>function_a</code> and <code>function_a</code>. Essentially an API like this:</p><pre><code>import tpl def function_a() -&gt; T1: ... def function_b() -&gt; T2: ... result_a: T1, result_b: T2 = tpl.invoke(function_a, function_b) </code></pre><p>This is all <em>possible</em> today but there are many constraints with the GIL. Free-threading will make parallel programming more popular in Python and we&rsquo;ll have to revisit some of the APIs.</p><h2>Problem 3: Maintaining two APIs is hard<a href="https://tonybaloney.github.io#problem-3-maintaining-two-apis-is-hard" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2><p>As a package maintainer, supporting both synchronous and asynchronous APIs is a big challenge. You also have to be selective with where you support async. Much of the stdlib doesn&rsquo;t support async natively (e.g. logging backends).</p><p>Python&rsquo;s <strong>Magic</strong> (<code>__dunder__</code>) methods cannot be async. <code>__init__</code> cannot be async for example, so none of your code can use network requests in the initializer.</p><h3>Async properties<a href="https://tonybaloney.github.io#async-properties" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3><p>This is an odd-pattern but I&rsquo;ll keep it simple to illustrate my point. You have a class <code>User</code> with a property <code>records</code>. This property gives a list of records for that user. A synchronous API is straightforward:</p><pre><code>class User: @property def records(self) -&gt; list[RecordT]: # fetch records from database lazily ... </code></pre><p>We can even use a lazily-initialized instance variable to cache this data.</p><p>Porting this API to async is a challenge because whilst <code>@property</code> methods can be async, standard attributes are not. Having to <code>await</code> some instance attributes and not others leaves a very odd API:</p><pre><code>class AsyncDatabase: @staticmethod async def fetch_many(id: str, of: Type[RecordT]) -&gt; list[RecordT]: ... class User: @property async def records(self) -&gt; list[RecordT]: # fetch records from database lazily return await AsyncDatabase.fetch_many(self.id, RecordT) </code></pre><p>Anytime you access that property, it needs to be awaited:</p><pre><code>user = User(...) # single access await user.records # if if await user.records: ... # comprehension? [record async for record in user.records] </code></pre><p><a href="https://tryexceptpass.org/article/controlling-python-async-creep/">The further we go into this implementation</a>, the more we wait for the user to accidentally forget to await the property and it fails silently.</p><h3>Duplicated implementations<a href="https://tonybaloney.github.io#duplicated-implementations" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3><p>The Azure Python SDK, a ginormous Python project supports both sync and async. Maintaining both is achieved via a lot of code-generation infrastructure. This is ok for a project with tens of full-time engineers, but for anything small or voluntary you need to copy + paste a lot of your code base to create an async version. Then you need to patch and backport fixes and changes between the two. The differences (mostly <code>await</code> calls) are big enough to confuse Git. I was reviewing some langchain implementations last year which had both sync and async implementation. Every method was copied+pasted, with little behavioral differences and their own bugs. People would submit bug fix PR&rsquo;s to one implementation and not the other so instead of merging directly, maintainers had to port the fix, skip it, or ask the contributors to do both.</p><h3>Backend fragmentation<a href="https://tonybaloney.github.io#backend-fragmentation" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3><p>Since we&rsquo;re largely talking about HTTP/Network IO, you also need to pick a backend for sync and async. For synchronous HTTP calls, <code>requests</code>, <code>httpx</code> are suitable backends. For <code>async</code>, its <code>aiohttp</code> and <code>httpx</code>. Since neither are part of the Python standard library, the adoption and support for CPython&rsquo;s main platforms is out of sync. E.g. as of today, <code>aiohttp</code> has <a href="https://pypi.org/project/aiohttp/#files">no Python 3.14 wheels, nor free-threaded support</a>. UV Loop, the alternative implementation of the event loop has <a href="https://pypi.org/project/uvloop/#files">no Python 3.14 support, nor any Windows support.</a> (Python 3.14 isn&rsquo;t out yet, so it&rsquo;s reasonable to not have support in either open-source project).</p><h3>Testing overhead<a href="https://tonybaloney.github.io#testing-overhead" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3><p>Further down the copy+paste maintainer overhead is the testing of these APIs. Testing your async code requires different mocks, different calls and in the case of Pytest a whole set of extensions and patterns for fixtures. This situation is so <a href="https://tonybaloney.github.io/posts/async-test-patterns-for-pytest-and-unittest.html">confusing I wrote a post about it and it&rsquo;s one of the most popular on my blog</a>.</p><h2>Summary<a href="https://tonybaloney.github.io#summary" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2><p>In summary, I think the use cases for asyncio are limited (mostly for reasons beyond the control of <code>asyncio</code>) and this has constrained it&rsquo;s popularity. Maintaining duplicate code-bases is a burden.</p><p>FastAPI, the web framework that&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.starlette.io/">async from-the-ground-up</a> grew in <a href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/pycharm/2025/08/the-state-of-python-2025/#python-web-devs-resurgence">popularity again</a> from 29% to 38% share of the web frameworks for Python, taking the #1 spot.

Considering the big use-case for async is HTTP and network IO, having the #1 web framework be an async one is a sign of asyncio&rsquo;s success. </p><p>I think in 3.14 the sub-interpreter executor and free-threading features make more parallel and concurrency use cases practical and useful. For those, we don&rsquo;t need <code>async</code> APIs and it alleviates much of the issues I highlighted in this post.</p><h2>Related Posts</h2> </div></section>]]></description><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 02:41:00 +0530</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
