That includes people who are in the country illegally as well as legal residents. </p><p>Immigrants make up almost 20% of the U.S. workforce and that data shows 45% of workers in farming, fishing and forestry are immigrants, according to Pew senior researcher Stephanie Kramer. About 30% of all construction workers are immigrants and 24% of service workers are immigrants, she added.</p><p>The loss in immigrant workers comes as the nation is seeing the first decline in the overall immigrant population after the number of people in the U.S. illegally reached an all-time high of 14 million in 2023.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s unclear how much of the decline we&rsquo;ve seen since January is due to voluntary departures to pursue other opportunities or avoid deportation, removals, underreporting or other technical issues,&rdquo; Kramer said. &ldquo;However, we don&rsquo;t believe that the preliminary numbers indicating net-negative migration are so far off that the decline isn&rsquo;t real.&rdquo;</p><p>Trump <span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-mass-deportations-latino-voters-ec64f85e3633c9c7a8a247eaf9feb64f">campaigned on a promise</a></span> to deport millions of immigrants working in the U.S. illegally.

At the same time, the number of illegal border crossings has plunged under his policies.</p><p>Pia Orrenius, a labor economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, said immigrants normally contribute at least 50% of job growth in the U.S.</p><p>&ldquo;The influx across the border from what we can tell is essentially stopped, and that&rsquo;s where we were getting millions and millions of migrants over the last four years,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;That has had a huge impact on the ability to create jobs.&rdquo;</p><h2>&lsquo;Crops did go to waste&rsquo; </h2><p>Just across the border from Mexico in McAllen, Texas, corn and cotton fields are about ready for harvesting.

It&rsquo;s a departure from typical patterns, where 25% of the U.S. crop goes to China. With prices 40% below three-year highs and production costs rising, hundreds of thousands of farmers face losses unless there&rsquo;s a trade resolution between the two countries.</p></li> </ul><p>American soybean farmers are heading into harvest season without a single order from China, historically their largest customer, raising alarm bells about the agricultural sector&rsquo;s stability and broader implications for the U.S. economy.</p><p><a href="https://soygrowers.com/board/caleb-ragland/">Caleb Ragland</a>, president of the American Soybean Association and a ninth-generation farmer from Kentucky, issued a stark warning about the crisis facing the nation&rsquo;s 500,000 soybean growers. &ldquo;Right now, we&rsquo;re in a very dire situation,&rdquo; Ragland said <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ronszen3/video/7547433656516693266">in a TikTok video</a> that has drawn national attention to farmers&rsquo; plight.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@heresyournews/video/7494329003998973230?q=soybean&amp;t=1757360127671">separate CNN interview</a>, Ragland emphasized the scale of China&rsquo;s importance to American agriculture: &ldquo;China takes more of our soybeans than all other foreign customers combined,&rdquo; he said, noting that 50% of U.S. soybeans are exported and China represents a quarter of total demand.</p><p>The absence of Chinese orders represents a dramatic departure from normal trading patterns.

That marks one of the sharpest annual recalibrations in recent history. Prior to Friday&rsquo;s release, economists had expected a revision closer to 682,000. The BLS noted that benchmark revisions are usually within a plus-minus of 0.2%. </p><p>After the update, the data paint a much weaker picture of hiring momentum. Job growth in 2024 now averages just 106,000 per month, down from the originally reported 168,000. For 2025 so far, the pace has slowed to only 44,000 jobs per month. </p><p>&ldquo;The revision shows the economy entered 2025 with less momentum than previously understood,&rdquo; said&nbsp;Bill Adams, chief economist at <a href="https://fortune.com/company/comerica/">Comerica</a> Bank&nbsp;in Dallas, in a statement to <em>Fortune</em>. The preliminary benchmark revision was worse than expected, the Comerica statement added. Accounting for it, job growth has been weak for most of this year. </p><h2>AI&rsquo;s fingerprints on tech layoffs</h2><p>The biggest hit came in the&nbsp;information industry, a category that includes internet companies, software publishing, and broadcasting. Employment here was revised down by 67,000, or 2.3%. Between March 2024 and March 2025, information sector jobs were revised down by 88,000, a 3% decline&mdash;and they&rsquo;ve continued falling into this summer. Adams noted that &ldquo;The revised data show more clearly that AI is automating away tech jobs.&rdquo;</p><p>Other sectors also saw notable downward revisions: </p><ul><li>Leisure and hospitality: down 176,000 jobs (1.1%)</li> <li>Wholesale trade: down 110,000 jobs (1.8%)</li> <li>Professional and business services&nbsp;(including temp agencies): down 158,000 jobs (0.7%)</li></ul><p>Still, it was the retrenchment in tech and information services that stood out to Adams, raising new concerns about how quickly advances in AI are reshaping the job market. A sweeping study by <a href="https://fortune.com/2025/08/26/stanford-ai-entry-level-jobs-gen-z-erik-brynjolfsson/">Stanford University economists</a> published in August found an outsized impact on entry-level tech roles exposed to automation by AI, with a 13% decline since 2022. Yet struggles with AI adoption have given some business leaders pause, with &ldquo;<a href="https://fortune.com/2025/09/07/stanford-professor-jure-leskovec-hand-written-graded-tests-ai/">human skills</a>&rdquo; emerging as a sorely needed complement to AI adoption. </p><p>The bottom line for Jeffrey Roach, chief economist for LPL Financial, was similar to Adams&rsquo; takeaway:&nbsp;&ldquo;The labor market appears weaker than originally reported.&rdquo; Solid household wealth is keeping the middle and upper-income consumer afloat, he added, but the economy is in the midst of &ldquo;an atypical business cycle.&rdquo; </p><p><em>For this story,&nbsp;</em>Fortune<em>&nbsp;used generative AI to help with an initial draft.

Another goal is to protect unauthorized workers from exploitation.&rdquo;</p><p>Building plants to manufacture the batteries and related computing chips for electric cars requires very specific technical knowledge, according to Ellen Hughes-Cromwick, former chief global economist at Ford.</p><p>&ldquo;You have certain positions that are very, very technical,&rdquo; said Hughes-Cromwick, now a senior visiting fellow at the center-left think tank Third Way. &ldquo;These are people who have installed the equipment before. &hellip; It&rsquo;s really ludicrous to think that we&rsquo;re not going to have foreign-born workers as part of our workforce as we get manufacturing back on our soil.&rdquo;</p><p>Battery plants require electromechanical processes that are far more complex than those at traditional car assembly plants, with proprietary industrial systems that most U.S. workers are not trained to operate. The engineers designing and building the plant need to have deep experience controlling potential contaminants, mixing volatile chemicals, and installing equipment that can handle voltage loads exponentially higher than those at legacy factories.</p></div></div></article> <section><header> </header><div><ul><p>We&#700;re unable to load stories right now.</p></ul></div></section></div></section>]]></description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Sep 2025 04:26:09 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/09/ben-jerrys-founders-call-brand-excluded-from-unilever-listing</link><title>Ben &amp;amp; Jerry’s founders call for the brand to be ‘freed’ from its owners (theguardian.com)</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/1ncu92k/ben_jerrys_founders_call_for_the_brand_to_be/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/1ncu92k/ben_jerrys_founders_call_for_the_brand_to_be/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p>Reading time: 4 min | <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/1ncu92k/ben_jerrys_founders_call_for_the_brand_to_be/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='preview-image'><img src='https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9bf8c00cecfe2996f27974b3be2a18ae9ff91577/1365_0_6827_5464/master/6827.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1a293a1727752d7336e9b4b91274815f' /></section><section class='parsed-content'><div><p>The co-founders of Ben &amp; Jerry&rsquo;s have called for the ice-cream brand to be made independent and excluded from current owner Unilever&rsquo;s plans to list its ice-cream business on the stock market.</p><p>Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield say The Magnum Ice Cream Company (TMICC), a new division of Unilever that is set to be separately listed in November and includes the brand founded by the pair in 1978 alongside Magnum, Cornetto and Wall&rsquo;s, &ldquo;must free Ben &amp; Jerry&rsquo;s&rdquo; in an open letter to prospective investors and the group&rsquo;s board.</p><p>The pair, who no longer have a financial interest in Ben &amp; Jerry&rsquo;s or any formal role, say they &ldquo;feel compelled to speak out &ndash; as concerned individuals&rdquo;.</p><figure><gu-island></gu-island></figure><p>&ldquo;We are deeply concerned that the commitments made to us, our employees, and our customers are being eroded.

As the vessel approached the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge, it appeared to stop, but that was an illusion created by its size and the slowness of its advance. Fifteen minutes later, it had managed to push its way under the bridge.</p><p>Throughout the years, I&rsquo;ve often compared the U.S. economy to a giant freighter that is tough to deflect from its course, and, since <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a> was elected for a second time, this metaphor has become particularly apt. Even as he subjected the economy, a colossus that generates more than thirty trillion dollars&rsquo; worth of goods and services annually, to a one-two-three punch of high tariffs (which raise prices), immigration restrictions (which reduce the labor supply), and <em>DOGE</em>-led job cuts in the federal government, things seemed, until recently, to be moving slowly ahead and defying the direst predictions about the consequences of <em>MAGA</em>nomics.</p><p>The G.D.P. growth rate turned negative during the first three months of this year, but that was largely a by-product of American households and businesses <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-financial-page/donald-trump-versus-barbie">rushing to import</a> more stuff before the tariffs went into effect. (G.D.P. measures domestic production of goods and services; imports don&rsquo;t count and they make the growth rate appear weaker.) Spurred partly by <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-financial-page/the-ai-profits-drought-and-the-lessons-of-history">corporate investments in A.I.</a>, over-all spending and job creation looked to be holding up, and, at the end of July, when the Department of Commerce reported that G.D.P. growth had rebounded to an annualized rate of positive three per cent in the second quarter, the White House hailed &ldquo;America&rsquo;s Golden Age,&rdquo; adding, &ldquo;The so-called &lsquo;experts&rsquo; were wrong (again).&rdquo;</p><p>Hubris is a killer. Two days later, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (B.L.S.) announced that job growth had slowed sharply during the three months from May to July, an indication that, despite the G.D.P. figures, the economy could well be on the verge of stalling. Trump promptly fired the commissioner of the agency, Erika McEntarfer, a Biden appointee, claiming, without any grounds whatsoever, that it had &ldquo;rigged&rdquo; the job numbers to make him look bad. This past Friday, the B.L.S., now under the temporary leadership of a longtime agency employee, William J. Wiatrowski, released its latest employment report, which confirms that hiring has stalled. &ldquo;Total nonfarm payroll employment changed little in August (+22,000) and has shown little change since April,&rdquo; the report said. The unemployment rate ticked up a tenth of a percentage point last month, to 4.3 per cent.</p><p>In recent years, response rates to the monthly government surveys of employers and households that form the basis of the jobs report have dropped; the figures are also subject to random sampling error and subsequent revisions as fresh data come in. But, contrary to the claims of some Trump apologists, the B.L.S. figures still provide the most comprehensive and objective portrait of employment trends that we have. And the recent numbers largely speak for themselves. Since May, job growth has averaged twenty-seven thousand per month. During the first quarter of this year, the average was about a hundred and eleven thousand jobs per month. By any measure, that&rsquo;s a significant slowdown.</p><p>Outside of health care and social assistance, a sector in which job growth seems to be unaffected by over-all trends, the downturn in hiring extended across large parts of the economy, with fewer than half of all private-sector industries adding jobs last month. This pattern is consistent with many different types of firms putting hiring plans on hold, or cutting workers, because of the uncertainty and chaos that Trump&rsquo;s tariffs have unleashed. It also jibes with the warnings that many economists critical of his policies issued <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-financial-page/will-trumpian-uncertainty-knock-the-economy-into-a-recession">earlier this year</a>.</p><p>The weakness in manufacturing, which was supposed to benefit from the pivot to all-out protectionism, is particularly striking. In August, the total number of people employed in the sector fell by twelve thousand in a one-month span; during the past three months, it has declined by thirty-one thousand. The latest survey from the Institute for Supply Management (I.S.M.), a not-for-profit organization that surveys firms throughout the economy on a monthly basis, provides a more granular portrait of what&rsquo;s happening. &ldquo;Tariffs continue to wreak havoc on planning/scheduling activities,&rdquo; a respondent in the electronics industry said. &ldquo;Plans to bring production back into [the] U.S. are impacted by higher material costs, making it more difficult to justify the return.&rdquo; Another respondent who works in trucking reported that the industry was in even worse shape than it had been during the Great Recession of 2008-09; they went on, &ldquo;This is 100 percent attributable to current tariff policy and the uncertainty it has created.&rdquo;</p><p>Then, there are Trump&rsquo;s other initiatives. The August employment report showed a fall of fifteen thousand in the number of federal employees, which suggests that the <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/deep-state-diaries"><em>DOGE</em> job cuts</a> may be starting to show up in the official figures. (Many of the people laid off were allowed to stay on the federal payroll for a few more months.) It&rsquo;s difficult to gauge the impact of Trump&rsquo;s draconian immigration policies, because undocumented workers are less likely to respond to official surveys. But there has surely been some effect. An analysis by Goldman Sachs showed that employment in industries in which more than ten per cent of the workforce is made up of unauthorized immigrants steeply declined over the summer. Another analysis, by Jed Kolko, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, reached a similar conclusion by examining the foreign-born workforce.</p></div><div><p>Nevertheless, the over-all employment picture is clearer. Another report that the B.L.S. released last week showed that, in July&mdash;for the first time since April, 2021, when the economy was still recovering from <em>COVID</em>-19 shutdowns&mdash;there were more unemployed people than job openings. Although the unemployment rate is still pretty low on a historical basis, job seekers are having a tougher time of it, and that includes everyone from high-school dropouts to recent college graduates.</p><p>In response to Friday&rsquo;s jobs report, Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody&rsquo;s Analytics, said the economy is now in a &ldquo;jobs recession.&rdquo; The question facing Federal Reserve policymakers, who will meet next week, is whether the employment numbers presages a broader slump. On this issue, the data are mixed. Even as hiring slowed last month, the average length of the workweek stayed steady. Layoffs seem to be a stream rather than a flood. Businesses are still spending <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-financial-page/is-the-ai-boom-turning-into-an-ai-bubble">heavily on A.I.</a>, and retail spending in July, the latest month for which we have such data, was pretty strong.</p><p>The big picture suggests that, though Trump hasn&rsquo;t yet sunk the great U.S. freight ship, he has knocked it off course. And he isn&rsquo;t done yet. This past week, his Administration asked the Supreme Court to <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-trumps-washington/how-many-court-cases-can-trump-lose-in-a-single-week">overturn a ruling</a> from the U.S. Court of Appeals that found that his blanket tariffs on goods from U.S. trading partners are illegal, and he also said that more sectoral tariffs are on the way, these ones aimed at semiconductors. Meanwhile, <em>ICE</em> and other federal agencies are ramping up their raids in search of undocumented workers.</p><p>A couple of weeks ago, Trump met with South Korea&rsquo;s President, Lee Jae-myung, at the White House and hailed his pledges of further investments in the United States. Then, on Thursday, federal agents went out to a construction site near Savannah, Georgia, where a vehicle-battery plant owned by two Korean companies, Hyundai and LG Energy Solution, is being built. They arrested nearly five hundred people, including scores of South Koreans, who were engaged in the crime of onshoring.</p><p>Evidently, maintaining coherence isn&rsquo;t a high priority of the <em>MAGA</em> program. In response to Friday&rsquo;s job figures, Kevin Hassett, the Trump-appointed head of the National Economic Council, touted the claim that native-born workers are taking jobs vacated by foreign-born workers. He failed to substantiate this, and even some Republicans don&rsquo;t seem convinced that <em>MAGA</em>nomics is working to their advantage. In a poll for <em>The Economist</em> that YouGov carried out over Labor Day weekend, just twenty-seven per cent of self-identified Republicans said they were better off financially than they were a year ago, and a similar number&mdash;twenty per cent&mdash;said they were worse off. In the survey as a whole, sixteen per cent of respondents said they were better off, while thirty-eight per cent said they were worse off.</p><p>Doubtless, these findings are connected to Trump&rsquo;s failure to fulfill his campaign pledge to bring down prices, along with his punishing tariffs and the bleak developments in the labor market.

The total revision was on the high end of Wall Street expectations, which ranged from a low around 600,000 to as many as a million.</p><p>The revisions were more than 50% higher than last year's adjustment and the largest on record going back to 2002. On a monthly basis, they suggest average job growth of 76,000 less than initially reported.</p><p>The numbers, which are adjusted from data in the quarterly census and reflect updated information on business openings and closings, add to evidence that the employment picture in the U.S. is weakening.</p><p>Most of the time span for the report came before President <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/donald-trump/">Donald Trump</a> took office, indicating the jobs picture was deteriorating before he began levying tariffs against U.S. trading partners.</p><p>"The BLS' preliminary benchmark revisions to nonfarm payrolls show a much weaker labor market over most of 2024 and early 2025 than previously estimated," said Oren Klachkin, market economist at Nationwide Financial. "Importantly, the slower job creation implies income growth was also on a softer footing even prior to the recent rise in policy uncertainty and economic slowdown we've seen since the spring. This should give the Fed more impetus to restart its cutting cycle."</p><p>Tuesday's revisions are not by themselves a reflection of current conditions as they go back as much as a year and a half. However, recent months' data also has been pointing to a soft labor market. The summer months of June, July and August saw average payroll growth of just 29,000 per month, below the break-even level for keeping the unemployment rate steady.</p><p>The largest markdowns came in leisure and hospitality (-176,000), professional and business services (-158,000) and retail trade (-126,200). Most sectors saw downward revisions, though transportation and warehousing and utilities had small gains. Almost all the revisions were confined to the private sector; government jobs were adjusted down by 31,000.</p><p>Stocks <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/08/stock-market-today-live-updates.html">reacted little to the release</a>, though Treasury yields erased losses and turned higher.</p><p>In addition to the economic concerns, the revisions also bring added heat to the BLS, which has been under fire from the White House for its data collection methods and results.</p><p>Following a weak jobs report for July that featured substantial downward revisions, President Donald Trump fired then-BLS Commissioner Erika McEntarfer and nominated Heritage Foundation economist E.J. Antoni as her successor. However, the August payrolls count was actually lower than July's and also featured revisions that took down the June total to a loss of 13,000 jobs, the first negative total since December 2020.</p><p>"Today, the BLS released the largest downward revision on record proving that President Trump was right: Biden's economy was a disaster and the BLS is broken," White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. "This is exactly why we need new leadership to restore trust and confidence in the BLS's data on behalf of the financial markets, businesses, policymakers, and families that rely on this data to make major decisions."</p><p>The benchmark revisions differ from the monthly adjustments in that they are far more encompassing.</p><p>Where the monthly moves come from additional survey data that comes in to the BLS, the annual revisions stem from more comprehensive information from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages as well as tax data that essentially offers a full do-over on the data, rather than the incremental course corrections of the monthly reports.</p><p>Moreover, the numbers announced Tuesday will face further revisions when the BLS releases the final benchmark figure in February 2026.</p><p>For the previous benchmark revision, which encompassed the 12 months prior to March 2024, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/21/nonfarm-payroll-growth-revised-down-by-818000-labor-department-says.html">the initial total was 818,000 fewer jobs</a>, later adjusted in February 2025 to 598,000, still the largest downward move since 2009.</p><p>As a share of the 171 million member labor force, the revisions amount to 0.6%. However, the political and economic ramifications could be considerable.</p><p>Additional signs of labor market weakness will add to the case that Trump has been pressing for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts.</p><p>The White House statement added that Fed Chair Jerome Powell "has officially run out of excuses and must cut the rates now."</p></div><div><h2>Don&rsquo;t miss these insights from CNBC PRO</h2></div></section>]]></description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Sep 2025 19:35:07 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://finbold.com/top-economist-points-to-proof-u-s-economy-is-in-recession/</link><title>Top economist points to 'proof' U.S. economy is in recession (finbold.com)</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/1ncgyje/top_economist_points_to_proof_us_economy_is_in/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/1ncgyje/top_economist_points_to_proof_us_economy_is_in/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p>Reading time: 2 min | <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/1ncgyje/top_economist_points_to_proof_us_economy_is_in/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='separator separator-before-parsed-content'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='parsed-content'><div><p>Amid lingering speculation about the health of the U.S. economy, insights from Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody&rsquo;s Analytics, suggest that a <a href="https://finbold.com/guide/recession-definition/">recession</a> may already be underway.</p><p>His warning <a href="https://finbold.com/top-economists-react-to-employment-data-as-u-s-enters-jobs-recession/">centered on labor market data</a>, where he pointed to the heavy reliance on two sectors, healthcare and hospitality, for what little job growth has occurred this year, Zandi said in an X <a href="https://x.com/Markzandi/status/1964726693978882416">post </a>on September 7.</p><p>Since the start of 2025, the economy has added only about 600,000 jobs.

He had a solid r&eacute;sum&eacute;, he thought: a paid internship at a civic-consulting firm, years of volunteering at environmental-defense organizations, experience working on farms and in parks as well as in offices, a close-to-perfect GPA, strong letters of recommendation. He would move anywhere on the West Coast, living out of his car if he had to. He would accept a temporary, part-time, or seasonal gig, not just a full-time position. He would do anything&mdash;filing paperwork, digging trenches&mdash;to build his dream career protecting California&rsquo;s wildlife and public lands.</p><p>He applied to 200 jobs. He got rejected 200 times. Actually, he clarified, he &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t get <em>rejected</em> 200 times.&rdquo; A lot of businesses never responded.</p><p>Right now, millions of would-be workers find themselves in a similar position. Corporate profits <a href="https://www.bea.gov/data/income-saving/corporate-profits">are strong</a>, the jobless rate is 4.3 percent, and wages are <a href="https://www.atlantafed.org/chcs/wage-growth-tracker">climbing in turn</a>. But payrolls have been essentially frozen for the past four months. The hiring rate has declined to <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/JTSHIR">its lowest point</a> since the jobless recovery following the Great Recession. Four years ago, employers were adding four or five workers for every 100 they had on the books, month in and month out. Now they are adding three.</p><p>At the same time, the process of getting a job has become a late-capitalist nightmare. Online hiring platforms have made it easier to find an opening but harder to secure one: Applicants send out thousands of AI-crafted r&eacute;sum&eacute;s, and businesses use AI to sift through them. What Bumble and Hinge did to the dating market, contemporary human-resources practices have done to the job market. People are swiping like crazy and getting nothing back.</p><p>Every time Harris logged in to LinkedIn or Indeed, he would see scores of gigs that seemed like they might be a good fit. He would read a posting carefully, scrub his r&eacute;sum&eacute;, tailor an introductory note, answer the company&rsquo;s screening questions, hit &ldquo;Send,&rdquo; hope for the best, and hear nothing in response&mdash;again and again and again.</p><p>Other job seekers described similar experiences. In suburban Virginia, a paralegal named Martine got laid off by a government contractor in April. (Like Harris, she did not want to dim her employment prospects by providing her full name.) She saw plenty of jobs being advertised at nonprofits, law firms, consultancies, and universities. She sent out dozens of applications. She even got to the second round a few times. But she never came close to being hired. &ldquo;I have 10 years of experience,&rdquo; she told me. &ldquo;I would be happy if a person told me no at this point.&rdquo;</p><p>For employers, the job market is working differently too. Businesses receive countless ill-fitting applications, along with a few good ones, for each open position. Rather than poring over the submissions by hand, they use machines. In a recent survey, chief HR officers told the Boston Consulting Group that they are <a href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/2025/ai-changing-recruitment">using AI</a> to write job descriptions, assess candidates, schedule introductory meetings, and evaluate applications. In some cases, firms are using chatbots to interview candidates, too. Prospective hires log in to a Zoom-like system and field questions from an avatar. Their performance is taped, and an algorithm searches for keywords and evaluates their tone.</p><p>Priya Rathod, a career-trends expert at Indeed, told me she understands why job seekers feel as if their r&eacute;sum&eacute;s are &ldquo;going into a void.&rdquo; But she argued that the online platforms make it easier for people to find open positions and that AI can &ldquo;get them to the next stage of the interview quicker,&rdquo; if their applications fit an employer&rsquo;s needs.</p><p>Still, a lot of job applicants never end up in a human-to-human process. The impossibility of getting to the interview stage spurs jobless workers to submit more applications, which pushes them to rely on ChatGPT to build their r&eacute;sum&eacute;s and respond to screening prompts. (Harris told me he does this; he used ChatGPT pretty much every day in college, and finds its writing to be more &ldquo;professional&rdquo; than his own.) And so the cycle continues: The surge in same-same AI-authored applications prompts employers to use robot filters to manage the flow. Everyone ends up in Tinderized job-search hell.</p><p>For months, the economy has been in a low-hire, low-fire equilibrium; virtually every sector of the labor market except for health care has been frozen. The amount of time a worker has spent looking for a job has climbed to an average of <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LNU03008276">10 weeks</a>, meaning that Americans are spending two weeks longer on the job market than they were a few years ago. The share of American workers quitting a job has fallen to its lowest <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/JTSQUR">level in a decade</a>, because of concerns about rising prices and jitters about slowing growth.</p><p>The equilibrium now seems to be falling apart, and a full-on recession looks likely. Black workers have experienced a dramatic <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LNS14000006">surge in joblessness</a>, in part because of the Trump administration&rsquo;s mass layoffs of federal employees. (The 154,000 civil servants who took the White House&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/02/doge-musk-federal-agencies-takeover/681744/">&ldquo;</a><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/02/doge-musk-federal-agencies-takeover/681744/">Fork in the Road</a><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/02/doge-musk-federal-agencies-takeover/681744/">&rdquo;</a> deferred-resignation offer will receive their last <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/07/31/federal-workers-doge-buyout-paid/">paycheck this month</a>.) More than 10 percent of workers under the age of 24 are searching for <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LNS14024887">a job</a>. &ldquo;Performance-based and strategic layoffs are increasing,&rdquo; Lydia Boussour of the consultancy EY-Parthenon wrote in a note to clients last week. &ldquo;Cracks are increasingly showing.&rdquo;</p><p>What is a worker supposed to do? Martine and Harris and millions like them are still trying to figure that out; she keeps on applying, whereas he is doing landscaping and volunteering. Rathod said that she recommends old-fashioned networking: asking recruiters out for coffee, going to in-person job events, and surveying friends and former employers for leads.</p><p>Such strategies might work if employers begin hiring again. But if not, millions more people might be left pitching their CVs into the void.</p></section><div class="gallery"><p><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/G3J3fAQrlILC_OcsAGs76IWlZmo=/438x0:1563x1125/80x80/media/img/mt/2025/09/2025_6_7_Impossible_To_Get_A_Job/original.jpg"></p></div></section>]]></description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Sep 2025 13:55:41 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/08/trump-tariff-refund-trade-treasury-bessent-supreme-court.html</link><title>Potential Trump tariff refund bill could top $1 trillion as Supreme Court fight looms (cnbc.com)</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/1nc6aak/potential_trump_tariff_refund_bill_could_top_1/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/1nc6aak/potential_trump_tariff_refund_bill_could_top_1/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p>Reading time: 6 min | <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/1nc6aak/potential_trump_tariff_refund_bill_could_top_1/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='preview-image'><img src='https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108195470-1757332160877-gettyimages-2234215725-wm107952_jrbozq6c.jpeg?v=1757332223&w=1920&h=1080' /></section><section class='parsed-content'><div><div><p>President Donald Trump speaks to reporters after stepping off Air Force One on September 7, 2025 at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland. </p><p>Kevin Dietsch | Getty Images</p></div><div><p>The <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/donald-trump/">United States government</a> has already collected tens of billions of dollars from President <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/donald-trump/">Donald Trump'</a>s "reciprocal tariffs."</p><p>But that money &mdash; and a lot more &mdash; could end up being <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/07/trump-trade-supreme-court-refunds-bessent.html">refunded</a> if the Supreme Court agrees with lower courts that many of the levies on imports from other countries are illegal.</p><p>How much could that end up being?</p><p>Anywhere between $750 billion to a whopping $1 trillion, warned Treasury Secretary <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/05/treasury-secretary-bessent-calls-for-big-changes-at-fed.html">Scott Bessent</a> in a declaration filed with the Supreme Court last week.</p><p>That eye-popping total could include the more than $72 billion in <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/trade?ftag=YHF4eb9d17">tariff revenue collected</a> so far by U.S. Border and Customs enforcement since Trump's "Liberation Day" announcement, according to data as of Aug. 24.</p></div><div><p>It would also include money projected to be collected from the at-risk tariffs by next June.</p><p>"Unwinding them could cause significant disruption," Bessent told the Supreme Court.</p><p>Bessent's declaration was part of a request by the Trump administration to have the Supreme Court quickly rule the tariffs are legal, and not wait until next summer, the normal time frame for such a decision.</p><p>The sooner the court rules, the less money the government could be required to refund&nbsp;if a majority of justices find the tariffs to be illegal.</p><p>Refunding tariffs is not an unprecedented situation for the U.S. government.

The <a href="https://www.mercer.com/en-us/about/newsroom/employers-are-bracing-for-the-highest-health-benefit-cost-increase-in-15-years/">National Survey of Employer-Sponsored Health Plans</a> by <a href="https://www.mercer.com/en-us/">Mercer</a>, a subsidiary of <a href="https://www.marshmclennan.com/">Marsh McLennan</a>, is part of the advisory firm&rsquo;s services to help employers manage health insurance costs while seeking to improve employee health and well-being.</p><div><p>Sunit Patel, Mercer&rsquo;s US Chief Actuary for Health and Benefits, said two factors are combining to send costs higher. &ldquo;Health benefit cost trend has two primary components &mdash;&nbsp;healthcare price and utilization. Right now, both are rising.&rdquo; </p><p>The survey projects that total health benefit costs per employee will increase by&nbsp;6.5% in 2026, even with planned cost-reduction measures, the highest jump since 2010. If employers left current plans unchanged, the increase would approach an alarming&nbsp;9%, underscoring the relentless pressure on employer healthcare budgets. This upcoming surge marks the fourth straight year of elevated health benefit cost growth, according to Mercer, breaking from a decade of more modest annual increases of about 3%. </p><h2>Multiple drivers fueling cost surge</h2><p>Some of the increases are due to advances in medical science. Advanced diagnostics and cutting-edge therapeutics, such as new cancer treatments and weight-loss medications, are transforming people&rsquo;s lives and bodies but come at steep costs compared to previous therapies. Provider consolidation into large health systems has strengthened bargaining power to set higher reimbursement rates with insurers. </p><p>Patel said more people have been using various health services over the past two years, likely because of the lingering effect of delayed or missed care due to the pandemic and an easing in healthcare labor constraints. &ldquo;The rise of virtual healthcare &mdash; and growing consumer acceptance of it, particularly in behavioral health &mdash; is also affecting utilization patterns,&rdquo; Patel said, &ldquo;because it removes geographic barriers to care and can be a more convenient option for patients.&rdquo;</p><p>Inflation has also played a significant role, with increased wages across the healthcare sector feeding further cost increases. The pandemic accelerated virtual healthcare adoption, making it easier for people to seek care; paradoxically, this easy access has contributed to higher overall utilization, driving up aggregate claims. </p><p>A Mercer spokesperson said in a statement to Fortune that this is the first 15-year high seen since the survey began in 1987.&nbsp; Previous comparisons include a 13-year high in 2002 (14.7%, the highest since 18.6% in 1988) , and a seven-year high in 2010 (6.9%, the highest since 2002). &ldquo;Cost growth was very volatile from 1987-2002, the early years of managed care, with sharp highs and lows,&rdquo; the spokesperson said, adding that cost growth stabilized to about 6%-7% annually starting around 2004, before slowing in 2012 to around 3%-4% annually.&nbsp; </p><h2>Employer responses: more cost-shifting</h2><p>Facing these mounting pressures, employers are taking aggressive action. The survey found 59% of companies plan to make cost-cutting changes to health plans in 2026, up sharply from 48% in 2025 and 44% in 2024. The predominant strategy involves&nbsp;raising<strong> </strong>deductibles and cost-sharing&nbsp;provisions, resulting in higher out-of-pocket costs for employees when they access care. Yet, many employers are also seeking ways to curb costs without simply passing the burden onto workers. For example, there is increased emphasis on&nbsp;managing high-cost claims and measuring program performance&nbsp;to guarantee value. </p><p>At the same time, enhancing mental-health benefits remains a priority post-pandemic, with about two-thirds of large employers planning to make behavioral healthcare more accessible in the next few years. Mercer&rsquo;s US Health and Benefits Leader, Ed Lehman, notes, &ldquo;Employers recognize it&rsquo;s essential for employee well-being and overall business performance.&rdquo; </p><h2>Your open enrollment this season</h2><p>For workers, the bottom line is the expense: Paycheck deductions for health coverage are expected to climb&nbsp;6% to 7% on average in 2026. This stems from the fact that employee premium shares typically rise in proportion to overall plan costs. In addition to higher premiums, increased deductibles and copays may further boost out-of-pocket expenses, forcing some employees to shoulder even greater financial strain.</p><p>Mercer said employees should &ldquo;carefully weigh premium cost and cost-sharing provisions&rdquo; during open enrollment, balancing premium costs with cost-sharing features to select the most appropriate plan for their needs. Mercer notes that more than a third of large employers will offer non-traditional, high-performance network plans in 2026&mdash;these options can help mitigate out-of-pocket costs by steering patients towards pre-selected providers known for quality and lower expenses. </p><p><em>[This report has been updated with a statement from a Mercer spokesperson.]</em> </p><p><em>For this story,&nbsp;</em>Fortune<em>&nbsp;used generative AI to help with an initial draft.

Robert N McCauley is a non-resident senior fellow at Boston University&rsquo;s Global Development Policy Center and associate of the faculty of history at the University of Oxford.</em></p><p>Dear Senators,</p><p>If you approve people to the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s Board of Governors who are willing to mix political moves in with its policies aimed at stable global dollar markets, you could harm US households and small US firms. You could also convince the rest of the world that the dollar cannot be relied on. Here is why.</p><p>Every day overseas banks roll over trillions in dollar borrowing. Such borrowing takes place in a collateralised cash market for repo, where the collateral is highly rated bonds like US Treasury securities. Such dollar borrowing also occurs in the foreign exchange market. There the collateral consists of euro cash, British sterling cash, Japanese yen cash and cash denominated in scores of other currencies. (These foreign currency collateralised dollar loans, known as foreign exchange swaps, <a href="https://www.bis.org/publ/qtrpdf/r_qt2212h.htm">are much larger</a> than the bond-collateralised repo loans, in part because firms report such swaps only in footnotes in their accounts.)</p><p>On 99.9% of days these dollar loans roll over silently without any difficulty. Once in a blue moon the market seizes up. It did so during the market dislocations of September and October 2008, and again in the Covid panic of March 2020.</p><p>The Fed was busy lowering its target interest rate in both cases, aiming to ease monetary conditions. But in both cases, the <a href="https://www.atlantafed.org/-/media/documents/research/publications/policy-hub/2024/05/15/02--offshore-dollar-and-us-policy.pdf">benchmark money market yield rose as foreign banks scrambled for dollars</a>. US households with adjustable-rate mortgages priced off of this benchmark and small US companies with similarly-priced bank loans faced sharply higher borrowing costs. What the Fed was giving, market turmoil threatened to more than take away.</p><p>The Fed successfully short-circuited this vicious market dynamic. It turned to a simple expedient that it had <a href="https://www.bis.org/publ/work851.pdf">pioneered in the 1960s</a> and had used on a handful of occasions since then, including during the Six Day War in June 1967. The Fed lent dollars to foreign central banks through so-called dollar-swap lines. And foreign central banks lent dollars to foreign commercial banks.</p><p>What an ingenious solution! The Fed took only the risk of lending to major central banks. These banks in turn took the risk of lending to foreign commercial banks. US households and small businesses enjoyed the benefit of lower loan rates.</p><p>In 2008 the Fed lent about half a trillion dollars to stabilise global dollar funding markets which were 100 times larger. In 2020, with its 2008 playbook in hand, the Fed lent even less than in 2008 to ensure that its easing got through to US households and businesses. The central banks all paid back the dollars and the Fed even earned a spread.</p><p>What if something happens in 2026 that leads global dollar funding markets to seize up?&nbsp;</p><p>It is essential that the Fed does the job that it knows how to do. But what if doing so strikes someone in power as unreciprocated generosity? Uncle Sucker &ldquo;<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/trump-administration-accidentally-texted-me-its-war-plans/682151/">bailing out Europe again</a>,&rdquo; to use the recent, unguarded phrase of the vice-president in a military context? Why not condition the Fed central bank swaps on tariffs, US exports or worthy geopolitical goals &mdash; as Stephen Miran, who&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/4824d298-fda1-4ca3-b93d-67f953d5fb90">confirmation hearing before the Senate Banking Committee is today</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/cc456664-363e-4c0c-aaf3-8bb9359a7ada">has argued</a>?</p><p>The record of attaching conditions to central bank loans in a crisis is not good.</p><p>A salient case was the <a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w6824/w6824.pdf">Austrian crisis of 1931</a>. The French authorities, holding lots of golden chips, made their help for the Austrian central bank <a href="https://econpapers.repec.org/bookchap/sprsprchp/978-3-031-16008-0_5f12.htm">contingent on no customs union</a> between Austria and Germany. The contingency was refused.&nbsp;</p><p>Crisis unchecked spread to Germany, toppling a Jewish-run bank (Danatbank) and leading to a moratorium on German international debts. The pound sterling abandoned its gold peg in September 1931.</p><p><a href="https://www.bis.org/publ/work978.htm">Recent research shows</a> that in the German elections of 1931 the National Socialists made particularly strong gains where the Danatbank had a larger presence.

After expanding after the pandemic, payrolls at manufacturing firms have shrunk this year, shedding 12,000 jobs last month alone.</p><p>Business surveys indicate that activity in the sector is in contraction.</p><p>Last month, 71% of manufacturers questioned by the Dallas branch of the Federal Reserve said the tariffs - which range from 10% to 50% on most imports - had already had a negative impact on their business, raising the cost of resources and hurting profits.</p><p>At Matouk, a maker of high-end bedding up the road from the Teixeiras', boss George Matouk said that between April and August tariffs had already added more than $100,000 (&pound;74,000) a month in costs, as they hit supplies like cotton fabric from India and Portugal and down from Liechtenstein.</p></div><figure><p><figcaption>George Matouk said he was seeing no benefits from the tariffs</figcaption></p></figure><div><p>Founded by his grandfather in 1929, the company has grown to employ about 300 people in recent years - a point of pride for Mr Matouk, who faced naysayers when he returned as the third generation to join the family business after graduating from Columbia Business School in the late 1990s.</p><p>But the sudden tariff expense has forced the firm to cut investments on things such as new equipment and spending on discretionary items like marketing. </p><p>Despite the made-in-America distinction of many of his products, Mr Matouk said he expected no benefits from the tariffs because higher costs were pushing him to raise prices, a move likely to weigh on sales.</p><p>"Because the materials are subject to tariffs just like everything else, the benefits are not there," he said.</p><p>Mr Matouk called the current challenges faced by his firm "demoralising in a new way", since they have been inflicted deliberately, by government policy.</p><p>"We've done all of the things we were supposed to do in order to invest in the industrial base of the United States when no one else was willing to do it and it's just really frustrating that now we're being penalised," he said.</p></div><figure><p><figcaption>Kim and Mike van der Sleesen, owners of Vanson Leathers</figcaption></p></figure><div><p>Studies on the impact of the more limited tariffs imposed by Trump during his first term on manufacturers in the US have found that small job gains in protected industries, like steel, were more than offset by losses at other firms that were dependent on parts. </p><p>But Mike van der Sleesen, who runs motorcycle jacket business Vanson Leathers, said he thought the changes this year had been so disruptive that it was premature to make predictions. </p><p>Mr van der Sleesen, who voted for Trump last year, is no fan of the president's tariffs, which have driven up his costs some 15% this year.</p><p>However, he shared the president's concerns that foreign companies could easily access the US market, while US firms looking to sell abroad encounter hurdles in the form of tariffs and other taxes.</p></div><figure><p><figcaption>One of the roughly 50 workers at Vanson Leathers</figcaption></p></figure><div><p>"It's been a very uneven and unfair trade path for a company like Vanson," said Mr van der Sleesen, whose business was founded in 1974 and employed more than 160 people as recently as 2000, before the wallop of China's entry into the global order shrunk the workforce to about 50. </p><p>"We shouldn't charge them and they shouldn't charge us in my view but that's never going to happen," he said. </p><p>For now, demand for his jackets, which can sell for thousands of dollars, has held up. He said his suppliers in the US were reporting an uptick in activity.</p><p>"We haven't heard overtime in the textile world for 20 years!" he said. "It's hard to be confident that you can predict what it's going to shake out to be because the changes have been so dramatic."</p></div><figure><p><figcaption>Retired transit worker Tom Teixeira believes it will take time for things to improve</figcaption></p></figure><div><p>On the streets of Fall River, many Trump supporters said they remained willing to give the president time to put his strategy to the test.</p><p>"We should be able to manufacture," said Tom Teixeira.</p><p>The 72-year-old retired transit worker voted for Trump in 2016, 2020 and 2024, won over in part by his message on the economy.</p><p>"I know how it was and it can improve but it's not going to improve overnight," said Mr Teixeira, who is not related to the Teixeira manufacturers, adding that he had yet to notice any major price increases this year. </p><p>"A year from now, if things aren't cheaper, we'll see."</p></div></article><div class="gallery"><p><img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d89f/live/e5a01420-89d8-11f0-a297-09bb36d02166.jpg.webp"></p><p><img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7fbe/live/ec0d6340-8a81-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg.webp"></p><p><img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1a65/live/89b0cfa0-89d9-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg.webp"></p><p><img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0838/live/acafdb40-89d9-11f0-a297-09bb36d02166.jpg.webp"></p><p><img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/cdef/live/4a688230-8a82-11f0-b4ed-15140726731b.jpg.webp"></p></div></section>]]></description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Sep 2025 18:22:51 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.ft.com/content/ecd1c563-08c9-4177-ad6f-652f06beb6fc</link><title>Why the Fed should not cut rates now (ft.com)</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/1nbmc8n/why_the_fed_should_not_cut_rates_now/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/1nbmc8n/why_the_fed_should_not_cut_rates_now/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p>Reading time: 3 min | <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/1nbmc8n/why_the_fed_should_not_cut_rates_now/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='separator separator-before-parsed-content'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='parsed-content'><div><main><div><div><div><p><span></span><span>Subscribe to unlock this article</span></p></div><div><div><h2><span><span>Limited time offer</span></span></h2><p><span><span><span>Save 50% off your first 6 months</span></span></span></p></div><p><span><span>Save now on essential digital access to quality FT journalism with the FT Digital Edition: today&rsquo;s FT, cover to cover on any device.</span></span></p></div></div><div><h2>Explore more offers.</h2><div><div><div><p><img src="https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https://barrier-page-components.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/assets/icons/primary_product_icon_trial.svg?source=next-barrier-page&amp;format=svg" alt></p><h3>Trial</h3></div><p><span><span>Rs100</span><span> for 4 weeks</span></span></p><p><span><span>Then </span><span>Rs4335</span><span> per month.

Agents focused on a plant that is still under construction at which Hyundai has partnered with LG Energy Solution to <span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/hyundai-georgia-lg-electric-vehicle-battery-58bdbe36e34179db41c95dc120851f77">produce batteries</a></span> that power EVs.</p><p>Cho said that more than <span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/immigration-raid-hyundai-plant-4dd1a6b2ad66d27567b2463c5f3c97bb">300 South Koreans were among the detained.</a></span></p><p>The operation was the latest in a long line of workplace raids conducted as part of the Trump administration&rsquo;s <span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-congress-deportations-immigration-raids-homeland-security-a2c6a2f726629e62bd0199aee68294f6">mass deportation agenda</a></span>. But the one Thursday is especially distinct because of its large size and because the targeted site has been touted as Georgia&rsquo;s largest economic development project.</p><p>The raid stunned many in South Korea because the country is a key U.S. ally. It agreed in July to purchase $100 billion in U.S. energy and make a $350 billion investment in the U.S. in return for the U.S lowering tariff rates. About two weeks ago, U.S. President Donald Trump and Lee held their <span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-south-korea-trade-lee-jae-myung-f80efa062dcc1b2430bbe3f12d6d1b6e">first meeting in Washington.</a></span></p><p>Trump said perhaps the U.S. could work out an arrangement with South Korean workers who would train U.S. citizens to do work such as battery and computer manufacturing.</p><p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t have people in this country right now that know about batteries, maybe we should help them along and let some people come in and train our people,&rdquo; Trump said Sunday night at Andrews Air Force Base. He added that &ldquo;the way you train people is bring people in that know what they&rsquo;re doing, let them stay for a little while and help.&rdquo;</p><p>Lee said the rights of South Korean nationals and economic activities of South Korean companies must not be unfairly infringed upon during U.S. law enforcement procedures. South Korea&rsquo;s Foreign Ministry separately issued a statement to express &ldquo;concern and regret&rdquo; over the case and sent diplomats to the site.</p><p>Video released by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Saturday showed a caravan of vehicles driving up to the site and then federal agents directing workers to line up outside. Some detainees were ordered to put their hands up against a bus as they were frisked and then shackled around their hands, ankles and waist. </p><div><bsp-figure> <figure><picture> <source width="1440" height="960" srcset="https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/94bb5f1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2454x1636+0+0/resize/1440x960!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F6b%2F87%2F1a327d1a9f3e9922f22ee11f09f4%2F6417c1b21e194cd78b14d63dea4740b0 1x,https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/4e309ce/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2454x1636+0+0/resize/2880x1920!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F6b%2F87%2F1a327d1a9f3e9922f22ee11f09f4%2F6417c1b21e194cd78b14d63dea4740b0 2x"> <source width="1440" height="960" srcset="https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/a46cd7f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2454x1636+0+0/resize/1440x960!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F6b%2F87%2F1a327d1a9f3e9922f22ee11f09f4%2F6417c1b21e194cd78b14d63dea4740b0 1x,https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/f837027/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2454x1636+0+0/resize/2880x1920!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F6b%2F87%2F1a327d1a9f3e9922f22ee11f09f4%2F6417c1b21e194cd78b14d63dea4740b0 2x"> <source width="1023" height="682" srcset="https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/d8c5b1b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2454x1636+0+0/resize/1023x682!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F6b%2F87%2F1a327d1a9f3e9922f22ee11f09f4%2F6417c1b21e194cd78b14d63dea4740b0 1x,https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/e552b64/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2454x1636+0+0/resize/2046x1364!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F6b%2F87%2F1a327d1a9f3e9922f22ee11f09f4%2F6417c1b21e194cd78b14d63dea4740b0 2x"> <source width="1023" height="682" srcset="https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/1766b26/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2454x1636+0+0/resize/1023x682!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F6b%2F87%2F1a327d1a9f3e9922f22ee11f09f4%2F6417c1b21e194cd78b14d63dea4740b0 1x,https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/d81f387/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2454x1636+0+0/resize/2046x1364!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F6b%2F87%2F1a327d1a9f3e9922f22ee11f09f4%2F6417c1b21e194cd78b14d63dea4740b0 2x"> <source width="767" height="511" srcset="https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/d3cc5a9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2454x1636+0+0/resize/767x511!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F6b%2F87%2F1a327d1a9f3e9922f22ee11f09f4%2F6417c1b21e194cd78b14d63dea4740b0 1x,https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/212299b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2454x1636+0+0/resize/1534x1022!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F6b%2F87%2F1a327d1a9f3e9922f22ee11f09f4%2F6417c1b21e194cd78b14d63dea4740b0 2x"> <source width="767" height="511" srcset="https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/e3415ce/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2454x1636+0+0/resize/767x511!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F6b%2F87%2F1a327d1a9f3e9922f22ee11f09f4%2F6417c1b21e194cd78b14d63dea4740b0 1x,https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/44ca702/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2454x1636+0+0/resize/1534x1022!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F6b%2F87%2F1a327d1a9f3e9922f22ee11f09f4%2F6417c1b21e194cd78b14d63dea4740b0 2x"> <source width="599" height="399" srcset="https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/0d79e25/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2454x1636+0+0/resize/599x399!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F6b%2F87%2F1a327d1a9f3e9922f22ee11f09f4%2F6417c1b21e194cd78b14d63dea4740b0 1x,https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/9268c45/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2454x1636+0+0/resize/1198x798!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F6b%2F87%2F1a327d1a9f3e9922f22ee11f09f4%2F6417c1b21e194cd78b14d63dea4740b0 2x"> <source width="599" height="399" srcset="https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/74c4038/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2454x1636+0+0/resize/599x399!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F6b%2F87%2F1a327d1a9f3e9922f22ee11f09f4%2F6417c1b21e194cd78b14d63dea4740b0 1x,https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/a96d731/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2454x1636+0+0/resize/1198x798!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F6b%2F87%2F1a327d1a9f3e9922f22ee11f09f4%2F6417c1b21e194cd78b14d63dea4740b0 2x"> <img alt="This image from video provided by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement via DVIDS shows manufacturing plant employees being escorted outside the Hyundai Motor Group&rsquo;s electric vehicle plant, Thursday, Sept. 4, 2025, in Ellabell, Ga.

As the country prepares to go to the polls on Monday, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/norway">Norway</a> is in the grip of a ferocious national argument that is likely to rumble on whichever party wins.</p><p>In an economy less then a seventh the size of Britain&rsquo;s, the <em>formuesskatt</em> raises about 32bn kroner (&pound;2.4bn). Multiply that by the difference in GDP, and the same rules applied in the UK could raise more than &pound;17bn &ndash; serious money in tax terms. Defenders say the wealth tax has another benefit. They see it as the cornerstone of a progressive tax system that has helped to create one of Europe&rsquo;s most equal societies.</p><p>But entrepreneurs are pushing back, financing lobbying campaigns and pouring money into politics and online advertising. There is even a protest song. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t come to Norway, we will tax you till you&rsquo;re poor, and when you have nothing left, we will tax you a little more,&rdquo; laments a business consultant in a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/embed/feed/update/urn:li:ugcPost:7188429685863727107">video posted on LinkedIn</a>. On the other side of the divide, the leader of the Socialist Left party has a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DCZYvsXuQJB/">&ldquo;wall of shame&rdquo;</a> in her office displaying the names of those who oppose or avoid the tax.</p><p>More disturbingly, the experts are under attack. Economists and statisticians have flagged a wave of disinformation, while being subjected to hate mail and targeted by newspapers.</p><p>Annette Alstads&aelig;ter, director of the <a href="https://www.nmbu.no/en/research/skatteforsk-tax-center">Skatterforsk Centre for Tax Research </a>at the Norwegian University of Life Sciences, has spoken in favour of the tax and authored a series of papers on avoidance and offshore wealth. She now weighs her public statements carefully, and has withdrawn from social media because of the risk of online abuse. &ldquo;People are so angry. Either you are very against or very for,&rdquo; she says.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been working on this for 15 years and it&rsquo;s always an issue but this time it has exploded,&rdquo; says the economist Mathilde Fasting, a member of the right of centre thinktank <a href="https://civita.no/">Civita</a> and one of those calling for abolition. &ldquo;Each time you talk about economic issues this tax will come up. It&rsquo;s like a symbol of all other things happening.&rdquo;</p><p>In a country where politics still gravitates to the centre, the wealth tax creates a clear dividing line between left and right. The row has evolved into a full culture war, with Trumpian appeals to aspirational young men who may not yet be rich enough to pay the levy, but oppose it on principle. On the YouTube show <em>Gutta</em> (Guys), four muscle-bound presenters filmed themselves <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=wUmHJwh9Rw4">pouring champagne over their wrist watches</a> while discussing &ldquo;tax refugees&rdquo;.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Jens Stoltenberg has promised to set up a cross-party commission to review all taxes if Labour is returned to power.</span> Photograph: Fredrik Varfjell/Reuters</figcaption></figure><p>Jens Stoltenberg, the former Nato secretary general and ex-Norwegian premier who returned to frontline politics in February as finance minister, has promised to set up a cross-party commission to review all taxes if Labour is returned to power. Thanks to his wide appeal, his party has risen in the polls, and is now ahead of the populist Progress party, which has promised to do away with the <em>formuesskatt</em>. In third place is the more moderate centre-right <em>H&oslash;yre</em>, which wants to slash the amount raised.</p><p>During his decade at the helm of Nato, Stoltenberg was dubbed &ldquo;the Trump whisperer&rdquo; after convincing the US president not to pull out of the security alliance during his first term. It seems settling the wealth tax dispute will take all of the diplomatic skills he deployed in that role. The trick will be to retain the tax without triggering an exodus of billionaires.</p><p>&ldquo;If a ton of people leave Norway that would be a problem,&rdquo; says the entrepreneur Karl Munthe-Kaas, who supports the tax. &ldquo;But if we let these groups that have all this money hold the rest of the country hostage, I have an issue with that.&rdquo;</p><p>Cut through the noise, and the underlying conversation is nuanced. Norwegians discuss tax with confidence, because they have access to all the right data. Almost uniquely among democratic nations, the tax returns of named individuals are public, <a href="https://www.skatteetaten.no/en/forms/search-the-tax-lists/">in a database</a> that all citizens can access. Likewise, information on companies is detailed and reliable.</p><p>Norway has levied a tax on wealth above a certain value since 1892, some years before securing full independence from Sweden. Along with Spain and Switzerland, it is one of only three European nations to still tax capital in this way. The current rate stands at 1% for those with assets of more than 1.7m kroner (&pound;125,000) and 1.1% for those with more than 20.7m kroner. The tax is collected annually, and is calculated by adding up the value of properties, savings, investments and shares, and deducting any debt. Private companies count as part of their owners&rsquo; wealth. There are discounts &ndash; for example, only 25% of the value of a primary residence is taxable.</p><figure><div><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af0845b4442a3ed378109162701e784f37dd238e/7_0_3739_2992/master/3739.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af0845b4442a3ed378109162701e784f37dd238e/7_0_3739_2992/master/3739.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af0845b4442a3ed378109162701e784f37dd238e/7_0_3739_2992/master/3739.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af0845b4442a3ed378109162701e784f37dd238e/7_0_3739_2992/master/3739.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af0845b4442a3ed378109162701e784f37dd238e/7_0_3739_2992/master/3739.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af0845b4442a3ed378109162701e784f37dd238e/7_0_3739_2992/master/3739.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none"><img alt="Harbor and financial district view of Oslo" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af0845b4442a3ed378109162701e784f37dd238e/7_0_3739_2992/master/3739.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="356.09521262369617"></source></source></source></source></source></source></picture></div><figcaption><span>Norway is one of only three European nations to levy a tax on wealth above a certain value.</span> Photograph: Drazen_/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>Although 720,000 citizens pay wealth tax, for most the annual contribution is small. Fasting says about 3,000 have taxable wealth of more than 100m kroner.</p><p>Among the biggest contributors is Gustav Magnar Witz&oslash;e, the heir to the SalMar fish farms business. In 2023, his wealth tax was <a href="https://www-nettavisen-no.translate.goog/nyheter/witzoe-far-330-mill-du-far-12-000-kroner/s/5-95-2500947?_x_tr_sl=no&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en&amp;_x_tr_pto=sc">330m kroner</a>. It was the only personal tax he paid as he had no income, according to reports based on his filings. Under the plans put forward by <em>H&oslash;yre</em>,<strong> </strong>it has been reported his bill would fall to zero. This is because the party is proposing to exclude what it calls &ldquo;working capital&rdquo; &ndash; essentially assets that are part of trading businesses.</p><p>Thanks to changes made by Labour the total wealth tax collected has risen from 18bn kroner in 2021, the year of the last election, to 32bn kroner last year. Estimates for 2025 are even higher.</p><gu-island><figure><a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/wwNKh/1/">graph</a></figure></gu-island><p>In 2022, the changes prompted departures. More than 30 billionaires and multimillionaires <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/10/super-rich-abandoning-norway-at-record-rate-as-wealth-tax-rises-slightly">left the country</a>, according to research by the newspaper Dagens N&aelig;ringsliv. They included the industrial tycoon Kjell Inge R&oslash;kke, the fourth richest Norwegian, with a fortune of about &pound;1.5bn, who relocated to Switzerland. There were warnings of lost tax revenues and damage to the economy, but three years later, it is clear that the exodus had limited impact.</p><p>In Norway, as elsewhere, the billionaires are getting richer. In 2024, the 400 wealthiest were worth 2.139tn kroner, <a href="https://www.lifeinnorway.net/richest-people/">up 14% in a year</a>, according to the business magazine Kapital. But it also reported half of this wealth was controlled by families relocated abroad.</p><p>Fasting believes more will leave. &ldquo;People are not investing here, not listing their companies, and finally moving out, which is serious. And I am sure that if the Labour party continues after the elections now you will see a boost of people moving,&rdquo; she says.</p><p>Her main argument for scrapping the tax is that it puts Norwegians at a disadvantage compared with foreign company owners. She says they have to take dividends out of their companies to pay the tax authorities, which means less money for growing businesses or starting new ones.</p><figure><a href="https://www.theguardian.com#EmailSignup-skip-link-22">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p>after newsletter promotion</p></figure><p>One of the loudest lobby groups is Aksjon for Norsk Eierskap &ndash; Action for Norwegian Ownership. Its backers include the salmon exporter Roger Hofseth. &ldquo;If the left wins this time, a lot of people will flee to Switzerland,&rdquo; Hofseth told a gathering last month.</p><p>&ldquo;There is this mentality that people who are self-made, they forget they are a product of the system,&rdquo; says Alstads&aelig;ter at the Centre for Tax Research. &ldquo;For me it&rsquo;s about justice. Everyone should pay a little bit. The rich get all these public goods. A stable political system, social security, and a highly educated population with access to free healthcare.&rdquo;</p><p>She believes some reforms are needed, saying the threshold of 1.7m kroner is too low.</p><p>With a sovereign wealth fund that collects the profits from Norway&rsquo;s abundant stocks of oil and gas able to contribute 25% of public spending each year, there is arguably no need for the <em>formuesskatt</em>.</p><p>&ldquo;To me, it&rsquo;s more about fairness,&rdquo; says Simen Markussen, the director of the Ragnar Frisch Centre for Economic Research in Oslo. &ldquo;It ensures that capital owners who don&rsquo;t have labour income are paying a reasonable amount of tax. It redistributes from the richest to everyone.&rdquo;</p><p>For the very rich, it is particularly effective, as it accounts for most of the personal taxes they pay.</p><gu-island><figure><a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/vBd8p/1/">graph</a></figure></gu-island><p>While the sums collected are not huge, they are meaningful. &ldquo;Compared with all taxes on personal income it&rsquo;s maybe 4.5%,&rdquo; says Markussen. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s big enough that if a politician says &lsquo;I want to abolish it&rsquo; they should be challenged on how this should be financed. Do you want to maintain those tax revenues, or what do you want to cut?&rdquo;</p><p>Munthe-Kaas founded the Oda grocery delivery business, which became Norway&rsquo;s first &ldquo;unicorn&rdquo;, a term used for startups valued at more than $1bn. He exited the company last year and no longer pays the wealth tax, but has done previously. He believes it works well, and would prefer a cut to corporation tax.</p><p>&ldquo;The wealth tax is not a choice between value creation versus distribution, it gives us both,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Any tax you bring in will reduce the ability to either invest or consume, whoever pays it. Taxing the rich isn&rsquo;t different in that sense to taxing a middle-class worker. So when rich people are upset they get less to invest, the same argument goes for anyone.&rdquo;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Karl Munthe-Kaas, who founded the Oda delivery grocery delivery business, believes the wealth tax works well.</span> Photograph: Millionaires for Humanity</figcaption></figure><p>Andr&eacute; Nilsen, a neuroscientist and kroner millionaire thanks to family money and his own investments, pays a small sum in wealth tax each year. He believes the <em>formuesskatt</em> should stay because it helps pay for social security. &ldquo;It is easier to get rich in Norway compared with other countries. You are free to go on wild explorations of ideas because you have a safety net that will catch you if it doesn&rsquo;t work out,&rdquo; he says.</p><p>Although the wealthy often give generously to charity, it cannot replace tax, he believes. &ldquo;There must be some kind of system above everyone that says at least do this.&rdquo;</p><p>There are other ways to target wealth. The UK &ndash; in common with many other countries &ndash; taxes dividends, capital gains and inherited money. But the rates can be much lower than those for wage-based income, and there are many loopholes and discounts.</p><p>Alstads&aelig;ter says the wealth tax is harder to dodge: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the only tax that cannot be avoided through restructuring while living in Norway, hence the opposition.&rdquo;</p></div><div class="gallery"><p><img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/34f318c2430988975cabaf4ca7840d2ff51e2229/1435_200_5674_4542/master/5674.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none"></p><p><img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36ba738f5680724c5ed011a597ca4bdd091c351a/0_6_3573_2858/master/3573.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none"></p></div></section>]]></description><pubDate>Sun, 07 Sep 2025 17:30:46 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://finance.yahoo.com/news/americas-job-market-is-cooling-and-the-youngest-workers-are-feeling-it-most-120003303.html</link><title>Why Americans are suddenly flocking to Dollar stores (finance.yahoo.com)</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/1naqhua/why_americans_are_suddenly_flocking_to_dollar/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/1naqhua/why_americans_are_suddenly_flocking_to_dollar/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p>Reading time: 4 min | <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/1naqhua/why_americans_are_suddenly_flocking_to_dollar/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='preview-image'><img src='https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/JrD9esUQxbp5GEhgHP7Q_Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03OTg-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-06/25f2b820-e9e1-11ec-bbb6-4b2eeeb07770' /></section><section class='parsed-content'><div><article><div><div><p>Updated <time>Sun, Sep 7, 2025, 1:53 AM</time> <span>4 min read</span></p></div></div><div><div><p>The US labor market is showing <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-economy-adds-22000-jobs-unemployment-rate-hits-43-in-august-as-labor-market-continues-dramatic-slowdown-153001609.html">clearer signs of softening.</a></p><p>And the strain is falling hardest on Americans just entering the job market. Labor Department data released Friday showed the unemployment rate for workers ages 16 to 24 <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LNS14024887">climbed to 10.5% in August</a>, the first time it's topped 10% since the pandemic.</p><p>The data comes against a backdrop of an increasingly tough job market for newly minted college grads. The unemployment rate for recent college graduates has consistently outpaced that of the broader workforce in the past several years, reversing a pre-pandemic trend when degree-holders typically fared better, according to a report from the Bank of America Institute published earlier this week.</p><p>In June 2025, the unemployment rate for recent graduates was 4.8%, compared with 4% for all workers and 7.4% for young workers without a degree, the report said, citing BLS and Census Bureau data <a href="https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/college-labor-market#--:explore:unemployment">compiled by the New York Fed.</a></p><p>The Institute defines "recent graduates" as workers ages 22 to 27 with at least a bachelor's degree, while "young workers" are those in the same age range without a bachelor's degree.</p><p>The divergence between the jobless rate for new grads and the broader population began emerging in the aftermath of the pandemic, with recent graduates starting to see consistently higher jobless rates compared to the broader labor force beginning in 2021. Economists pointed to particular weakness in white-collar occupations, with consulting, tech, finance, and other degree-heavy fields facing layoffs and hiring freezes after the pandemic boom.</p><p>"People with college degrees like recent graduates might be finding themselves in an increasingly competitive environment that doesn't necessarily guarantee the same level of employment security that it once did," Taylor Bowley, economist at the Bank of America Institute, told Yahoo Finance.</p><figure> <figcaption>Young workers face the toughest job market since the 1980s, according to the Bank of America Institute.

That uncertainty has only deepened amid the turbulence of President Trump's unprecedented second term. And while some hesitation is typical ahead of elections, Bowley said this moment feels different.</p><p>"It's not atypical to see uncertainty before an election, because businesses wait to see what policies a new administration might bring," she said. "But this is a different kind of uncertainty &mdash; one that's been quite persistent since the start of the year and seems to be ongoing."</p><p><em>Read more: </em><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/taxes/article/do-you-pay-taxes-on-unemployment-210102160.html"><em>Do you pay taxes on unemployment?</em></a></p></div></div></article> <section><header> </header> </section></div><div class="gallery"><p><img src="https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/84CCs1bfjUB9qnzDdDEOEw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTgwO2g9ODA-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-06/4420aee0-51d2-11f0-adff-254e36c3f7d7"></p></div></section>]]></description><pubDate>Sun, 07 Sep 2025 16:42:27 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.aol.com/finance/does-really-112-131-income-180000531.html</link><title>Does it really take a $112,131 income for Americans to consider themselves ‘middle class’?

Between 2015 and 2025, that figure jumped from 134 million shipments per year to about 1.4 billion. U.S. Customs and Border Protection was processing more than 4 million "de minimis" shipments to the U.S. daily, the White House said.&nbsp;</p><p>Before the measure took effect, the postal union sent a letter to U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio to express concerns about its impact.</p><p>The <span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/de-minimis-us-tariffs-exemption-low-value-imports-ends/">de minimis provision</a></span> was added to the Tariff Act of 1930 several years after the law was passed. It was designed to facilitate trade by eliminating the administrative burden of collecting modest import duties on low-cost goods.&nbsp;</p><p>Purchases that previously entered the U.S. without needing to clear customs now require vetting and are subject to their origin country's applicable tariff rate, which can range from 10% to 50%.</p><p>While the change applies to the products of every country, U.S. residents will not have to pay duties on incoming gifts valued at up to $100, or on up to $200 worth of personal souvenirs from trips abroad, according to the White House.</p><p>The UPU said its members had not been given enough time or guidance to comply with the procedures outlined in the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/07/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-is-protecting-the-united-states-national-security-and-economy-by-suspending-the-de-minimis-exemption-for-commercial-shipments-globally/">executive order President Trump signed</a> on <span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-ends-de-minimis-loophole-on-imports/">July 30</a></span> to eliminate the duty-free eligibility of low-value goods.</p><ul> <li><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/tag/united-states-postal-service/">United States Postal Service</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/tag/trump-administration/">Trump Administration</a></li> </ul> </section> </article> </div><div class="gallery"><p><img src="https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/2025/08/29/f8c0885c-da42-4059-ac01-e7fe3a928553/cbsn-fusion-what-the-end-of-the-low-cost-tariff-exemption-means-for-consumers-thumbnail.jpg"></p></div></section>]]></description><pubDate>Sun, 07 Sep 2025 00:47:14 +0530</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
