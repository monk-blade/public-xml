Roughly 70% of U.S. economic growth <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/can-rich-continue-prop-up-us-consumer-spending-2025-08-18/#:~:text=In%20the%20U.S.%2C%20%22the%20consumer,the%20health%20of%20the%20economy.">comes from</a> consumer spending, yet most households <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/2025-rise-americans-living-paycheck-2128753">live</a> paycheck to paycheck. That demand picture has taken on a shape that analysts call&nbsp; K-shaped: while many families cut back on essentials, wealthier households continue to spend on travel, tech, and luxury goods&mdash;and they continued to do so in August. For now, the inflation recovery depends heavily on this dynamic remaining in fragile stasis. It&rsquo;s a fix that works well until it doesn&rsquo;t, if it could be described as working at all.</p><p>&ldquo;[Spending] may well be skewed toward higher-earning consumers,&rdquo; Powell told reporters after the Fed&rsquo;s latest policy meeting. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot of anecdotal evidence to suggest that.&rdquo; </p></div><p>That skew has become increasingly obvious in markets. Just seven firms &mdash; <a href="https://fortune.com/company/microsoft/">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://fortune.com/company/nvidia/">Nvidia</a>, <a href="https://fortune.com/company/apple/">Apple</a>, <a href="https://fortune.com/company/alphabet/">Alphabet</a>, <a href="https://fortune.com/company/facebook/">Meta</a>, <a href="https://fortune.com/company/amazon-com/">Amazon</a>, and <a href="https://fortune.com/company/tesla/">Tesla</a> &mdash; now make up <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor-hub/article/sp-500-weight-mag-7-stocks-diversification-risk/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">more than 30%</a> of the S&amp;P 500&rsquo;s value. Their relentless AI capex is keeping business investment positive, even as overall job growth has slowed to a crawl. Goldman Sachs <a href="https://fortune.com/2025/09/09/sp-500-capex-ai-share-buybacks-goldman-sachs/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">estimates</a> AI spending accounted for nearly all of the 7% year-over-year gain in corporate capex this spring.</p><p>The comments underscore a widening concern at the Fed: that while headline GDP growth is holding above 1.5%, the composition of that growth is uneven, unlike previous booms in housing or manufacturing.&nbsp; </p><p>Powell pointed to &ldquo;kids coming out of college and younger people, minorities&rdquo; as <a href="https://fortune.com/2025/09/17/jerome-powell-says-gen-z-hiring-nightmare-college-kids-hard-time/">struggling</a> to find jobs in today&rsquo;s cooling labor market, even as affluent households continue to spend freely and companies funnel cash into cutting-edge technologies. </p><p>The imbalance reflects what Powell described as &ldquo;a low firing, low hiring environment,&rdquo; where layoffs remain rare but job creation has slowed to a crawl. That dynamic, combined with the concentration of economic gains in AI and among the wealthy, risks deepening inequality, and complicates the Fed&rsquo;s attempt to balance its inflation and employment mandates. </p><p>That disconnect risks widening the gap between Wall Street and Main Street. While affluent households continue to spend freely and tech titans pour billions into data centers and chips, revised jobs data show the economy added just 22,000 positions in August, with unemployment edging up to 4.3%. </p><div><p>&ldquo;Unusually large&rdquo; AI investment may sustain top-line growth, Powell suggested, but it&rsquo;s doing little to lift the broad labor market.</p><p>&ldquo;The overall job finding rate is very, very low,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If layoffs begin to rise, there won&rsquo;t be a lot of hiring going on.&rdquo;</p></div></div><p><strong>Fortune Global Forum</strong> returns Oct. 26&ndash;27, 2025 in Riyadh.

Trump has accused Cook of mortgage fraud because she appeared to claim two properties, in Michigan and Georgia, as &ldquo;primary residences&rdquo; in June and July 2021, before she joined the board. Such claims can lead to a lower mortgage rate and smaller down payment than if one of them was declared as a rental property or second home. </p><p>&ldquo;Put simply, the President may reasonably determine that interest rates paid by the American people should not be set by a Governor who appears to have lied about facts material to the interest rates she secured for herself &mdash; and refuses to explain the apparent misrepresentations,&rdquo; Solicitor General D.

According to documents <span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/federal-reserve-lisa-cook-trump-852820c83e5001ec3b6e2d14047965c9">obtained by The Associated Press</a></span>, Cook did specify that her Atlanta condo would be a &ldquo;vacation home,&rdquo; according to a loan estimate she obtained in May 2021. And in a form seeking a security clearance, she described it as a &ldquo;2nd home.&rdquo; Both documents appear to undercut the Trump administration&rsquo;s claims of fraud. </p><p>U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb ruled that the administration <span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/federal-reserve-governor-lisa-cook-trump-firing-651fcf0637cf14901bbd559df00c856b">had not satisfied a legal requirement</a></span> that Fed governors can only be fired &ldquo;for cause,&rdquo; which she said was limited to misconduct while in office. Cook did not join the Fed&rsquo;s board until 2022. </p><div><bsp-figure> <figure> <a></a><picture> <source width="800" height="533" srcset="https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/e5bfb79/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5400x3600+0+0/resize/800x533!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2Fcc%2Fed%2F0174f24b867f4b6532b1b09745b9%2F9ba952c0838c4d4c90d4fc12bc578d08 1x,https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/25ed0bf/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5400x3600+0+0/resize/1600x1066!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2Fcc%2Fed%2F0174f24b867f4b6532b1b09745b9%2F9ba952c0838c4d4c90d4fc12bc578d08 2x"> <source width="800" height="533" srcset="https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/b30c6df/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5400x3600+0+0/resize/800x533!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2Fcc%2Fed%2F0174f24b867f4b6532b1b09745b9%2F9ba952c0838c4d4c90d4fc12bc578d08 1x,https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/f00086b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5400x3600+0+0/resize/1600x1066!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2Fcc%2Fed%2F0174f24b867f4b6532b1b09745b9%2F9ba952c0838c4d4c90d4fc12bc578d08 2x"> <source width="767" height="511" srcset="https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/4972815/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5400x3600+0+0/resize/767x511!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2Fcc%2Fed%2F0174f24b867f4b6532b1b09745b9%2F9ba952c0838c4d4c90d4fc12bc578d08 1x,https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/2a97acd/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5400x3600+0+0/resize/1534x1022!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2Fcc%2Fed%2F0174f24b867f4b6532b1b09745b9%2F9ba952c0838c4d4c90d4fc12bc578d08 2x"> <source width="767" height="511" srcset="https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/afa4b19/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5400x3600+0+0/resize/767x511!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2Fcc%2Fed%2F0174f24b867f4b6532b1b09745b9%2F9ba952c0838c4d4c90d4fc12bc578d08 1x,https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/de665dc/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5400x3600+0+0/resize/1534x1022!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2Fcc%2Fed%2F0174f24b867f4b6532b1b09745b9%2F9ba952c0838c4d4c90d4fc12bc578d08 2x"> <source width="599" height="399" srcset="https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/6cd1caf/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5400x3600+0+0/resize/599x399!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2Fcc%2Fed%2F0174f24b867f4b6532b1b09745b9%2F9ba952c0838c4d4c90d4fc12bc578d08 1x,https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/3f44561/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5400x3600+0+0/resize/1198x798!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2Fcc%2Fed%2F0174f24b867f4b6532b1b09745b9%2F9ba952c0838c4d4c90d4fc12bc578d08 2x"> <source width="599" height="399" srcset="https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/381d41b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5400x3600+0+0/resize/599x399!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2Fcc%2Fed%2F0174f24b867f4b6532b1b09745b9%2F9ba952c0838c4d4c90d4fc12bc578d08 1x,https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/63a4bcd/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5400x3600+0+0/resize/1198x798!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2Fcc%2Fed%2F0174f24b867f4b6532b1b09745b9%2F9ba952c0838c4d4c90d4fc12bc578d08 2x"> <img alt="Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, left, talks with Board of Governors member Lisa Cook, right, during an open meeting of the Board of Governors at the Federal Reserve, June 25, 2025, in Washington.

Policymakers opted for a quarter-point cut to the central bank's benchmark rate, in line with expectations. It's now set at 4% to 4.25%.</p><p>"The labor market is really cooling off," Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at a news conference Wednesday after the announcement. </p><p>The Trump administration has mounted an unprecedented pressure campaign that has included attacks on Powell for not lowering rates sooner, as well as an effort to unseat a Biden-era Fed appointee over accusations of mortgage fraud. </p><p>But Powell and the Fed had resisted Trump's pressure, saying its dual mandate of keeping both unemployment and inflation low meant it needed to be careful not to overheat the economy and risk a return to rapidly rising prices.</p><p>"We&rsquo;ve done very large rate hikes and very large rate cuts in the last five years, and you tend to do those at a time when you feel that policy is out of place and needs to move quickly to a new place," Powell said. "That&rsquo;s not at all what I feel."</p><p>The vote for the quarter-point cut by the Fed's rate-setting committee was 11 to 1. The sole dissenter, in favor of a larger half-point cut, was<strong> </strong>newly appointed governor Stephen Miran. He was sworn in this week even as he maintains his title as chair of the White House&rsquo;s Council of Economic Advisers, though he is officially on leave from that role.</p><p>President Donald Trump's two other appointed governors, Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller, both voted for the quarter-point cut.</p><p>In its statement Wednesday, the Fed indicated it expects two more rate cuts this year. However, seven of the 12 officials on the Fed's rate-cutting committee indicated that rates should remain unchanged for the rest of the year. </p><p>The committee will meet again in October and December.<strong> </strong></p><p>The labor market appears to be slowing dramatically.<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/august-2025-jobs-report-how-many-which-industries-what-to-know-rcna228780"> August&rsquo;s jobs report showed</a> that just 22,000 jobs were added, far below economists&rsquo; expectations. That report also showed that the United States lost jobs in June. So far this year, the economy has added 598,000 jobs, compared with 1.4 million for the first eight months of 2024. The unemployment rate also ticked higher last month, to 4.3%, a level not seen since September 2017 outside of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p>At the news conference, Powell called the labor market &ldquo;unusual,&rdquo; noting that fewer firms are hiring &mdash; but that the available supply of workers is also declining because of Trump&rsquo;s immigration crackdown. </p><p>Lower rates could help businesses hire as it becomes less expensive to take out loans and credit card rates fall for consumers.</p><p>At the same time, inflation has been creeping up. Since April, when Trump announced his sweeping &ldquo;reciprocal&rdquo; tariffs,<a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CPIAUCSL#"> inflation has increased</a> from 2.3% to 2.9% in August. The Fed&rsquo;s inflation target is 2%.</p><p>Fed officials said in a separate set of economic projections that they see two additional quarter-point rate cuts this year and a third in 2026. </p><p>&ldquo;After weak July and August employment reports and<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/911000-fewer-jobs-created-april-2024-march-2025-bls-says-rcna230065"> a large negative preliminary benchmark revision</a>, job growth now appears to be much lower and below the breakeven rate, the risks still tilt toward further negative revisions, the unemployment rate has risen slightly for two months in a row, and our broader measure of labor market slack has risen a bit more,&rdquo; Goldman Sachs economists wrote.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Heading into Wednesday,<a href="https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html"> markets were pricing</a> in a high likelihood of a total of three-quarters of a percentage point in cuts by the end of the year.</p><p>In recent interviews and earnings calls, companies have also flagged slower spending by a large chunk of the population.</p><p>McDonald&rsquo;s CEO Chris Kempczinski called it a &ldquo;two-tier economy&rdquo; in a CNBC<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/09/02/mcdonaldas-ceo-middle-and-lower-income-consumers-are-under-a-lot-of-pressure-right-now.html"> interview this month.</a> While upper-income households continue to spend freely, &ldquo;middle- and lower-income consumers, they&rsquo;re feeling under a lot of pressure right now.&rdquo;</p><p>Several prominent economists aren&rsquo;t convinced a Fed cut is warranted at this point. Joseph Gagnon, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, noted last month that inflation was still lingering above the Fed&rsquo;s 2% target even before Trump&rsquo;s tariffs. &ldquo;Price pressures are likely to pick up in coming months as businesses are forced to pass on higher tariff costs to protect their profit margins,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>Stock markets are thriving, too.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not unprecedented for the Fed to ease when stocks are at or near all-time highs,&rdquo; JPMorgan Chase chief U.S. economist Michael Feroli said in early August. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s rarer when stocks are at the highs and inflation is above target and inflecting higher.&rdquo;</p><p>This Fed meeting is also the first with Miran, the newly confirmed governor, who joins the Fed under highly unusual circumstances. Members of the independent central bank historically haven&rsquo;t held other outside roles during their tenures. Miran is on unpaid leave from the economic advisers council and could return to the White House when his Fed term concludes at the end of January. The administration has sought to downplay the arrangement.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s anything irregular about it at all,&rdquo; Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Tuesday on CNBC.</p><p>&ldquo;Everyone knows that he&rsquo;s going back&rdquo; to the White House, &ldquo;so I think cards on the table it&rsquo;s actually much more transparent,&rdquo; Bessent added.</p><p>The Trump administration has sought to further increase its influence on the Fed by trying to fire Lisa Cook, the first Black woman to work on the board of governors, over allegations of mortgage fraud. Cook hasn&rsquo;t been charged with a crime. An appeals court has ruled she can&rsquo;t be removed while she sues the administration over its attempt to terminate her. For now, Cook remains in place.</p><p>It all comes after months of attacks from Trump. Seeking lower rates, he and others in his administration have hammered Powell with personal insults and have said the entire Fed board should be &ldquo;ashamed&rdquo; of its work.</p><p>But Powell has maintained that the Fed must remain cautious.</p><p>"We&rsquo;ve seen much more challenging economic times, but from a policy standpoint ... it&rsquo;s challenging to know what to do," Powell said Wednesday.

In 2021, 38% of scores were between 600 and 749; in 2025, that percentage is 33.8%. The highest FICO score is 850.</p><p>U.S. borrowers continue to grapple with high interest rates, a side effect of the Federal Reserve’s efforts to rein in the soaring post-pandemic inflation that’s driving high prices. In spite of those efforts—and with rate cuts imminent—President Trump’s tariffs are pushing inflation up yet again, making the cost of gas, groceries, clothes, and other essentials even less affordable. </p><p>“The recent K-shaped economy has led to financial stress for some borrowers impacted by affordability concerns stemming from inflation and higher interest rates, while others have benefited from increases in their stock market portfolios and home price appreciation,” the FICO report states. That data reflects America’s wealth gap, wherein the rich get richer and the poor get poorer, hollowing out the middle class in the process.</p><p>Falling credit scores among young people are linked to resumed student loan delinquency reporting, which reappeared on credit reports in February for the first time after the CARES Act. While only 17% of the broader U.S. population is still paying down a student loan, that percentage is 34% for Gen Z. It’s no surprise then that 14% of Gen Zers had a 50-point score drop in the last year, with late student loan payments hitting their credit reports for the first time.</p><p>For people in the U.S distant from the stock market’s highs, the economy is starting to feel like America during a very different era—a malaise backed by the new data. “Delinquency rates on auto loans, credit cards, and personal loans are at or near their highest levels since 2009, during the Great Recession—and are more consistent with an economy in recession than one still in expansion,” the FICO report states.</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/1nj87c9/us_credit_scores_suffers_largest_2year_drop_since/neob80n/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><div class="md"><p>I don’t know enough about credit scoring in aggregate, but wouldn’t this be a sign that we are already underway an economic event?
