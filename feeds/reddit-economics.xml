Between 2015 and 2025, that figure jumped from 134 million shipments per year to about 1.4 billion. U.S. Customs and Border Protection was processing more than 4 million "de minimis" shipments to the U.S. daily, the White House said.&nbsp;</p><p>Before the measure took effect, the postal union sent a letter to U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio to express concerns about its impact.</p><p>The <span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/de-minimis-us-tariffs-exemption-low-value-imports-ends/">de minimis provision</a></span> was added to the Tariff Act of 1930 several years after the law was passed. It was designed to facilitate trade by eliminating the administrative burden of collecting modest import duties on low-cost goods.&nbsp;</p><p>Purchases that previously entered the U.S. without needing to clear customs now require vetting and are subject to their origin country's applicable tariff rate, which can range from 10% to 50%.</p><p>While the change applies to the products of every country, U.S. residents will not have to pay duties on incoming gifts valued at up to $100, or on up to $200 worth of personal souvenirs from trips abroad, according to the White House.</p><p>The UPU said its members had not been given enough time or guidance to comply with the procedures outlined in the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/07/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-is-protecting-the-united-states-national-security-and-economy-by-suspending-the-de-minimis-exemption-for-commercial-shipments-globally/">executive order President Trump signed</a> on <span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-ends-de-minimis-loophole-on-imports/">July 30</a></span> to eliminate the duty-free eligibility of low-value goods.</p><ul> <li><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/tag/united-states-postal-service/">United States Postal Service</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/tag/trump-administration/">Trump Administration</a></li> </ul> </section> </article> </div><div class="gallery"><p><img src="https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/2025/08/29/f8c0885c-da42-4059-ac01-e7fe3a928553/cbsn-fusion-what-the-end-of-the-low-cost-tariff-exemption-means-for-consumers-thumbnail.jpg"></p></div></section>]]></description><pubDate>Sun, 07 Sep 2025 00:47:14 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.smh.com.au/world/north-america/a-jobs-slump-spurred-trump-to-sack-his-stats-boss-this-time-around-he-s-got-no-one-to-blame-20250906-p5msve.html</link><title>A jobs slump spurred Trump to sack his stats boss.

Trump&rsquo;s pick to replace McEntarfer is yet to be confirmed by the US Senate.</p></div><div><p>The bureau found total non-farm payrolls, a widely watched indicator of US economic health, rose just 22,000 in August &ldquo;and has shown little change since April&rdquo;. Job gains in the healthcare sector were partially offset by losses in the federal government and in mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction, it said.</p><p>The August report also made further revisions to earlier months&rsquo; data, finding that in June, the US economy actually lost 13,000 jobs, rather than gaining 14,000 (a number which had already been revised down from 147,000).

But he also warned that Trump needed to finalise his policies on tariffs and trade.</p></div><div><p>&ldquo;Concluding tariff actions and trade deals to provide businesses with the certainty they need to hire, invest in new capital equipment, and realign supply chains,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Manufacturing will be treading water until we see those changes.&rdquo;</p><figure><figcaption><p><span>Sacked BLS chief Erika McEntarfer.</span><cite><span>Credit: </span>US Bureau of Labor Statistics</cite></p></figcaption></figure><p>Justin Wolfers, an Australian economics professor at the University of Michigan, said the data was worrying and indicated rosy assessments of the US economy&rsquo;s resilience were premature. &ldquo;Bad policy leads to bad outcomes, but the actual economy doesn&rsquo;t move at the pace of the political cycle,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>Wolfers credited bureau staff for compiling the data &ldquo;despite the arbitrary firing of their boss, uninformed social media insults, and the prospect of being led by an unqualified ideologue&rdquo;.</p><p>Trump&rsquo;s pick for the job, E.J. Antoni, is the chief economist at the Heritage Foundation, a right-wing think tank that produced the conservative blueprint Project 2025. On Friday, CNN reported Antoni once ran a now-deleted Twitter account that contained sexually degrading attacks on Kamala Harris, conspiracy theories and anti-gay remarks.</p></div><div><p>Meanwhile, Trump is engaged in a different form of reality-denial. Hours before the employment data was released, he was asked whether he would accept the numbers. He dismissed the question, saying &ldquo;the real numbers&rdquo; would come out in a year or so, once his economic agenda was realised.</p><p>Life is more difficult when you can&rsquo;t just shoot the messenger.</p><p><b><i>Get a note directly from our foreign </i></b><b><i>correspondents </i></b><b><i>on what&rsquo;s making headlines around the world. </i></b><a href="https://www.smh.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p56l7u"><b><i>Sign up for our weekly What in the World newsletter</i></b></a><b><i>.</i></b></p></div></div><div><section><header><h2>Most Viewed in World</h2></header><p><span><span>Loading</span></span></p></section></div></div></article><div class="gallery"><p><img src="https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.189%2C$multiply_0.7725%2C$ratio_1.5%2C$width_756%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/c0ac78b194c30249aa466dce98d35c8904cb6918"></p><p><img src="https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.378%2C$multiply_0.7725%2C$ratio_1.5%2C$width_756%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/98d6bda8b8730d5656ecea5ef1abceb81c48bfda"></p><p><img src="https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.378%2C$multiply_0.7725%2C$ratio_1.5%2C$width_756%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/79adde6be61b3428b7c0b148f8f8474f5b426859"></p><p><img src="https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.844%2C$multiply_0.7487%2C$ratio_1%2C$width_378%2C$x_0%2C$y_35/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/6e87f68ac53bafa298818989bda5b97cd9a306aa474f1bd273691b84f39c856e"></p></div></section>]]></description><pubDate>Sat, 06 Sep 2025 07:41:16 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/05/politics/economy-jobs-report-trump-agenda</link><title>Trump’s economy problem is threatening his entire agenda (cnn.com)</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/1n9fcuf/trumps_economy_problem_is_threatening_his_entire/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/1n9fcuf/trumps_economy_problem_is_threatening_his_entire/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p>Reading time: 11 min | <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/1n9fcuf/trumps_economy_problem_is_threatening_his_entire/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='preview-image'><img src='https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2230148969.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill' /></section><section class='parsed-content'><div><p>President Donald Trump came into office with massive plans to overhaul the way the US government operates and consolidate power in himself. </p><p>And he&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/11/politics/trump-blowback-looming-analysis">been largely successful</a> in implementing that vision, thanks to a cowed Congress, timid institutions and a languid judiciary. </p><p>But there are growing signs that his entire agenda could be undercut and his party could face massive political consequences because of his hubris on the single most important issue to Americans: the economy. </p><p>A new <a href="https://www.cnn.com/business/live-news/us-jobs-report-august-2025">Bureau of Labor Statistics report</a> Friday confirms some the worst fears about a worsening jobs market. A brief recap: </p><div><ul> <li> <span> Preliminary numbers show just 22,000 jobs added in August, a very low number for an economy that generally needs to create about 100,000 jobs every month to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/03/economy/jobs-report-october-final">keep up with population growth</a>. </span> </li> <li> <span> Revisions in other months mean the economy has created only an estimated 107,000 jobs over the last four months combined. Apart from recessions and their aftermaths, those are the worst numbers in decades. </span> </li> <li> <span> June&rsquo;s jobs numbers were revised into negative territory (13,000 jobs lost), making it the first negative month since December 2020. </span> </li> <li> <span> Despite Trump&rsquo;s promises of his tariffs revitalizing U.S. manufacturing boom, that industry has now lost 78,000 jobs this year. </span> </li> </ul> </div><p>The Trump administration has made pains to try to neutralize headlines about these jobs numbers, including last month by <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/04/business/bureau-of-labor-statistics-jobs-report-explainer-hnk">baselessly suggesting the numbers are being rigged</a> to make them look bad. (There is no evidence for this, and there are safeguards to prevent such manipulation.) After a bad July jobs report, Trump fired the head of BLS and now aims to replace her with <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/05/politics/kfile-ej-antoni-bureau-of-labor-statistics-twitter-account-vis">a controversial loyalist</a>. </p><p>If Trump&rsquo;s past is predicate, such conspiracy theories are likely to be revisited. But on Friday morning, there was apparently only so much the administration could do to spin these numbers. </p><p>Trump himself took aim at Jerome Powell, re-upping a familiar attack on the Fed Chair over his not lowering interest rates. Others acknowledged the report wasn&rsquo;t what they were hoping for. </p><p>&ldquo;This jobs number was certainly a little bit of a disappointment right now,&rdquo; top White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett said on CNBC, while predicting some upward revisions. </p><p>Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer acknowledged on Fox Business that the new report &ldquo;underperformed a bit,&rdquo; while emphasizing that it at least contained some jobs gains (a very low bar, to be sure). </p><p>And Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick seemed to plead for patience, asking people to judge Trump&rsquo;s jobs record not today but in 12 months. </p><p>&ldquo;You look at the unemployment rate numbers today &ndash; wait until a year from today,&rdquo; Lutnick said in CNBC. &ldquo;Wow. It will be amazing numbers.&rdquo; </p><p>But that&rsquo;s asking a lot. People are already judging Trump&rsquo;s stewardship of the economy more negatively than ever before. And while Trump arguably earned the benefit of the doubt when his tariffs didn&rsquo;t lead to immediate and crushing consequences, he still faces a deeply skeptical public and potentially disastrous political consequences. </p><p>A Quinnipiac University poll in late August showed Trump with his <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3929">worst economic approval numbers to date</a>, in either of his two terms: 57% disapproving to 39% approving. </p><p><a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/694370/trump-ratings-mood-stay-tepid-august.aspx">Gallup</a> pegged his economic approval rating at just 37%, after averaging 52% in his first term. Just 29% of independents approved. </p><p>A <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/910985644/Yahoo-YouGov-Crime-Poll-August-2025">Yahoo News-YouGov poll</a> showed Americans disapproved of Trump on the &ldquo;cost of living&rdquo; by more than a 2-to-1 margin, 62-29%, and by a large margin on trade and tariffs, 58-35%. </p><div><picture><source height="undefined" width="679" srcset="https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2228231689.jpg?c=original&amp;q=w_679,c_fill/f_webp"><source height="undefined" width="967" srcset="https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2228231689.jpg?c=original&amp;q=w_967,c_fill/f_webp"><source height="undefined" width="860" srcset="https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2228231689.jpg?c=original&amp;q=w_860,c_fill/f_webp"><source height="undefined" width="860" srcset="https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2228231689.jpg?c=original&amp;q=w_860,c_fill/f_webp"><source height="undefined" width="860" srcset="https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2228231689.jpg?c=original&amp;q=w_860,c_fill/f_webp"><img src="https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2228231689.jpg?c=original&amp;q=w_860,c_fill" alt="Customers enter a grocery store in Westminster, California, on August 7." height="1600" width="2399"></source></source></source></source></source></picture> </div><p>We&rsquo;re also seeing some real cracks even in Trump&rsquo;s ever-loyal base. The Yahoo poll showed 27% of Republicans disapproved of Trump on the cost of living. And a Pew Research Center poll last month showed <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2025/08/14/how-americans-view-the-trump-administrations-tariff-policies-and-the-gops-budget-and-tax-bill/">32% of Republican-leaning voters disapproved</a> of his tariffs strategy. </p><p>All of which suggests the patience of even Trump&rsquo;s loyal supporters has already been tested. Are they really going to give him a year to straighten it all out? </p><p>The danger for Trump is that the economic picture turns bad enough that it sours Americans on the entire enterprise. </p><p>Trump&rsquo;s power plays are largely built on acquiescence. People might not like his methods, but they don&rsquo;t necessarily want to fight him on it. As long as these things don&rsquo;t impact them directly, the backlash is limited. </p><p>Indeed, many of Trump&rsquo;s most controversial initiatives are pretty unpopular &ndash; things like deporting people without due process, putting troops on US soil, the Department of Government Efficiency cuts, and Trump&rsquo;s signature agenda bill that cut Medicaid. We&rsquo;ve already seen <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/17/politics/gop-malaise-trump-epstein-analysis">cracks in Trump&rsquo;s base on some of these issues</a> &ndash; along with, most pronouncedly, the administration&rsquo;s handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files. </p><p>But none of those issues has caused a real revolt by Congress or anyone who could impede his agenda. </p><p>The economy is perhaps the one thing that could change that rather quickly, and bring these readily apparent concerns about his presidency to the fore. </p><p>Should things continue to turn sour, Trump and Co. can blame BLS data and the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s interest rates all they want. But it won&rsquo;t be difficult for Americans to trace all of it to something that&rsquo;s much easier to grasp and attach to Trump: his economy-rocking moves to unilaterally implement huge tariffs. These are moves that he made without consulting Congress, after all, and despite the (gently expressed) reservations of congressional Republicans who spent decades hailing free trade. </p><p>Trump did this despite persistent inflation that still hadn&rsquo;t really abated. He voluntarily took ownership of an already-tenuous situation and injected it with a huge amount of uncertainty. </p><p>Trump invested gobs of political capital in this. It&rsquo;s looking more and more like a bad bet. </p></div><div class="gallery"><p><img src="https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2025-09-05t135925z-374478399-rc2plga3zhi7-rtrmadp-3-usa-economy.jpg?c=original&amp;q=w_860,c_fill"></p></div></section>]]></description><pubDate>Sat, 06 Sep 2025 01:29:21 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.vox.com/scotus/460312/supreme-court-trump-tariffs-vos-selections</link><title>Trump’s lawyers just inadvertently admitted that his tariffs are illegal (vox.com)</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/1n96fxd/trumps_lawyers_just_inadvertently_admitted_that/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/1n96fxd/trumps_lawyers_just_inadvertently_admitted_that/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p>Reading time: 7 min | <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/1n96fxd/trumps_lawyers_just_inadvertently_admitted_that/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='preview-image'><img src='https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/gettyimages-2208184612.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.732984293194%2C100%2C78.534031413613&w=1200' /></section><section class='parsed-content'><div><p>The Trump administration formally asked the Supreme Court on Wednesday evening to decide whether President Donald Trump&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26082943-20250903-trump-v-vos-selections-cert-petition/">ever-shifting tariff policy is lawful</a>.

It has no basis in law, and it has only ever been used against one president in history: Joe Biden.</p><div><form><div><h2>SCOTUS, Explained</h2><p><span>Get the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser.</span></p></div></form></div><p>That said, the Court did preview the doctrine in an Obama-era decision that applied it to a hypothetical regulation. In that case, <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/pdf/12-1146.pdf"><em>Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA</em></a> (2014), the Republican justices announced that &ldquo;we expect Congress to speak clearly if it wishes to assign to an agency decisions of vast &lsquo;economic and political significance.&rsquo;&rdquo; The idea was that, even if a federal law can be read to permit the executive to enact a particular policy, courts should read those laws narrowly if the policy is too ambitious.</p><p>Indeed, under Biden, the Court even used this recently made-up doctrine to <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/2023/6/30/23779903/supreme-court-student-loan-biden-nebraska-john-roberts">strike down policies that are unambiguously authorized by federal law</a>. In <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/22-506_nmip.pdf"><em>Biden v. Nebraska</em></a> (2023), the Republican justices struck down the Biden administration&rsquo;s attempt to cancel many student loans. But federal law could not possibly have been clearer that the executive is permitted to cancel these loans.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/STATUTE-117/pdf/STATUTE-117-Pg904.pdf#page=1">relevant statute</a> gave the education secretary broad authority to &ldquo;waive or modify any statutory or regulatory provision applicable to the student financial assistance programs&rdquo; during a national emergency such as the COVID-19 pandemic. The secretary could use this power, moreover, &ldquo;notwithstanding any other provision of law, unless enacted with specific reference to&rdquo; the statute authorizing him to cancel loans.</p><p>Nevertheless, the Republican justices overrode this statute, pointing to the loan cancellation plan&rsquo;s high price tag of &ldquo;<a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/22-506_nmip.pdf">between $469 billion and $519 billion</a>.&rdquo; The &ldquo;economic and political significance&rdquo; of such a plan, they concluded, &ldquo;is staggering by any measure.&rdquo; And thus the program must be canceled.</p><div><p>Which brings us back to Trump&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26082943-20250903-trump-v-vos-selections-cert-petition/">petition asking the justices to hear the tariffs case</a>. That petition describes the tariffs as Trump&rsquo;s &ldquo;most significant economic and foreign-policy initiative.&rdquo; It claims that the tariff is necessary to close US trade deficits of &ldquo;$1.2 trillion per year.&rdquo; It alleges that the tariffs have given Trump leverage to extract multi-trillion-dollar concessions from foreign nations. And it also claims that the increased taxes Trump has unilaterally imposed on imports &mdash; taxes that will <a href="https://budgetlab.yale.edu/research/short-run-effects-2025-tariffs-so-far">largely be paid by the American consumer</a> &mdash; &ldquo;<a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26082943-20250903-trump-v-vos-selections-cert-petition/">will reduce federal deficits by $4 trillion in the coming years</a>.&rdquo;</p></div><p>Trump, in other words, claims that the economic significance of these tariffs is an order of magnitude greater than the significance of the student loan program at issue in <em>Nebraska</em> &mdash; the one the Republican justices said they must strike down because its significance is &ldquo;staggering by any measure.&rdquo;</p><p>To be sure, it&rsquo;s never a good idea for a court to base its decisions on factual claims made by this particular administration. But independent analysis confirms that the economic and political significance of the tariffs is at least as &ldquo;staggering&rdquo; as the significance of Biden&rsquo;s student loan program. An August analysis of the tariffs by Yale&rsquo;s Budget Lab, for example, concluded that Trump&rsquo;s tariffs will cost the average American household $2,400 in 2025, and that the tariffs will <a href="https://budgetlab.yale.edu/research/state-us-tariffs-august-7-2025">raise $2.7 trillion in taxes</a> over a 10-year window.</p><div><h2>At least one of the Court&rsquo;s Republicans appears to think that the major questions doctrine doesn&rsquo;t apply to Trump</h2></div><p>It would seem, then, that a straightforward application of the major questions doctrine compels this Court to invalidate Trump&rsquo;s tariffs. But Justice Brett Kavanaugh already appears to be looking for a way to bail out Trump. Concurring in <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/24-354_0861.pdf"><em>FCC v. Consumers&rsquo; Research</em></a> (2025), Kavanaugh suggested that this newly invented doctrine does not apply to &ldquo;foreign policy contexts.&rdquo;</p><p>Trump&rsquo;s petition also suggests <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26082943-20250903-trump-v-vos-selections-cert-petition/">other ways the Court could exempt him</a> from the doctrine, including a claim that the doctrine doesn&rsquo;t apply when the president personally authorizes a federal policy, instead of promulgating that policy through a federal agency.</p><p>Are these arguments persuasive? The truth is that there&rsquo;s no such thing as a persuasive argument involving the major questions doctrine, because the whole thing is a figment of the Republican justices&rsquo; imagination. The Court has <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/23791610/supreme-court-major-questions-doctrine-nebraska-biden-student-loans-gorsuch-barrett">never published</a> a majority opinion claiming that this doctrine can be found in any provision of the Constitution, or in any federal statute. And while some individual justices have offered their own explanations of where this recently invented doctrine comes from, those explanations range from silly to ridiculous.</p><div><p>Concurring in <em>Nebraska</em>, for example, Justice Amy Coney Barrett claimed that the doctrine is <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/22-506_nmip.pdf">implicit in a parable about a babysitter</a>.</p></div><p>Asking whether the doctrine applies to foreign policy decisions, in other words, is a bit like asking your daughter whether her imaginary friend likes fried chicken. The answer is whatever your daughter wants it to be.</p><p>As Justice Clarence Thomas wrote in a concurring opinion earlier this year, &ldquo;judge-made doctrines can be difficult for courts to apply&rdquo; because those courts &ldquo;<a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/23-1039_c0n2.pdf">lack an underlying legal authority on which to ground their analysis</a>.&rdquo; If the major questions doctrine derived from a constitutional provision, then the justices could read that provision to determine if it contains a foreign policy exception. If it derived from a statute, they could refer to the statute.</p><p>But, because the major questions doctrine is simply something that the Republican justices made up, there is no principled way to determine if it conveniently contains an exception that just happens to rescue a Republican president&rsquo;s &ldquo;most significant economic and foreign-policy initiative&rdquo; from invalidation.</p><p>That said, courts are supposed to apply the same rules to Democratic presidents that they apply to Republicans. If the Republican justices actually buy Trump&rsquo;s claim that he is exempt, that will leave little doubt that these justices are <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/458863/supreme-court-nih-public-health-grants-gobbledygook">simply playing Calvinball</a> &mdash; creating one set of rules to spite Democrats, and a different, far more favorable set of rules for Republicans.</p></div></section>]]></description><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2025 19:45:06 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/05/jobs-report-august-2025.html</link><title>Payrolls rose 22,000 in August, less than expected in further sign of hiring slowdown (cnbc.com)</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/1n941b8/payrolls_rose_22000_in_august_less_than_expected/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/1n941b8/payrolls_rose_22000_in_august_less_than_expected/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p>Reading time: 5 min | <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/1n941b8/payrolls_rose_22000_in_august_less_than_expected/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='preview-image'><img src='https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108194186-1756986229072-gettyimages-2228223483-US_JOBS.jpeg?v=1756986317&w=1920&h=1080' /></section><section class='parsed-content'><div><div><p>Job creation sputtered in August, adding to recent signs of labor market weakening and likely keeping the Federal Reserve on track for a widely anticipated interest rate cut later this month.</p><p><a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm">Nonfarm payrolls</a> increased by just 22,000 for the month, while the unemployment rate rose to 4.3%, according to a Bureau of Labor Statistics report Friday.

Revisions also showed a net loss of 13,000 in June after the prior estimate was lowered by 27,000.</p></div><div><p>"The job market is stalling short of the runway," said Daniel Zhao, chief economist at jobs site Glassdoor. "The labor market is losing lift, and August's report, along with downward revisions, suggests we're heading into turbulence without the soft landing achieved."</p><p>Markets largely disregarded the report, with <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/04/stock-market-today-live-updates-.html">stocks up at the open</a> and Treasury yields sharply lower. Traders in the futures markets raised the probability of a quarter percentage point Fed rate cut to 100% and went even further, pricing in a 12% probability of a half-point move, according to the CME Group's <a href="https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html?redirect=/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html">FedWatc</a>h gauge.</p><p>The payrolls count was the first since President Donald <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/01/trump-erika-mcentarfer-jobs-report-fired.html">Trump fired former BLS Commissioner Erika McEntarfer</a> following the release of the July jobs report a month ago. The move came after the report showed not just a weak level of job creation but also dramatic reductions in previous months' totals.</p><p>In McEntarfer's place, the president nominated economist E.J. Antoni, a Trump loyalist from the Heritage Foundation who previously had criticized the BLS numbers as being politically distorted. William Wiatrowski is serving as acting BLS commissioner.</p><p>While the pace of hiring was slow, average hourly earnings increased 0.3% for the month, meeting the estimate, though the annual gain of 3.7% was slightly below the forecast for 3.8%.</p></div><div><p>Hiring was held back by a payroll reduction in the federal government, which reported a decline of 15,000.</p><p>Health care again led sectors, adding 31,000 jobs, while social assistance contributed 16,000. Wholesale trade and manufacturing both saw declines of 12,000 on the month.</p><p>The report comes as markets widely expect the Fed to lower its benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point when it releases its next decision Sept. 17. Fed Chair <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/jay-powell/">Jerome Powell</a> and his fellow policymakers also have been under heavy criticism from the president as they have been on hold since last cutting in December 2024.</p><p>Though most economic indicators indicate continued expansion, Fed officials have expressed concern about a slowdown in hiring even as layoffs have held fairly steady. At the same time, policymakers worry that <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/donald-trump/">Trump</a>'s tariffs could reignite inflation, with data indicating a slow but steady increase in prices over recent months.</p><p>"The warning bell that rang in the labor market a month ago just got louder. A weaker-than-expected jobs report all but seals a 25-basis-point rate cut later this month," said Olu Sonola, head of U.S. economic research at Fitch Ratings. "Four straight months of manufacturing job losses stand out. It's hard to argue that tariff uncertainty isn't a key driver of this weakness."</p><p>While the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.b.htm">establishment survey</a> showed weak job creation, the more volatile <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.a.htm">household count</a>, used to calculate the unemployment rate, held better news.</p><p>That report showed an increase of 288,000 employed, though the ranks of the unemployed also rose by 148,000. The labor force participation rate edged higher to 62.3% while the labor force swelled by 436,000, accounting for the tick higher in the unemployment rate.</p></div><div><p>A broader measure of unemployment that includes discouraged workers and those holding part-time jobs for economic reasons climbed to 8.1%, a 0.2 percentage point increase and the highest level since October 2021.</p><p>Along with the jobs numbers tally, the BLS on Tuesday will release the initial estimate for annual benchmark revisions to the numbers dating back one year from March 2025.</p><p>Revisions have been a source of controversy, particularly in the post-Covid era as the response rate has declined, particularly for the headline establishment survey that asks businesses and government agencies to detail the pace of hiring.</p><p>The BLS typically releases its initial estimate with the first batch of survey responses it gets, then updates two times as it gets more information. However, Trump has accused the BLS of being politically biased. The firing of McEntarfer drew widespread criticism in the economics and markets community.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/05/jobs-hassett-trump-rates.html">CNBC interview</a>, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said he expects the August payrolls count to get revised higher. In the past three years, the initial August count actually was revised lower from the initial estimate.</p><p><em>Correction: The BLS on Tuesday will release the initial estimate for annual benchmark revisions to the numbers dating back one year from March 2025.

When sellers are competing for a small pool of buyers, that indicates a </span><a href="https://www.redfin.com/news/buyers-market-february-2025/"><span>buyer&rsquo;s market</span></a><span>. And when it&rsquo;s a buyer&rsquo;s market, home prices can fall because buyers have negotiating power.&nbsp;</span> </p><p><b>Sellers outnumber buyers for several reasons:</b></p><ul> <li><b>It&rsquo;s expensive to buy a home:</b><span> High home prices and mortgage rates are scaring buyers off. The median home sale price rose 1.6% year over year to $431,931 in April. That&rsquo;s the slowest growth in nearly two years, but monthly housing payments still hit a </span><a href="https://www.redfin.com/news/housing-market-update-record-high-housing-costs-sales-decline/"><span>record</span></a> <a href="https://www.redfin.com/news/housing-market-update-record-high-housing-costs-economic-uncertainty/"><span>high</span></a><span> last month because mortgage rates and prices remain elevated. The average 30-year-fixed mortgage rate was </span><a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=1bnGA"><span>6.73%</span></a><span> in April&mdash;more than double the record low hit during the pandemic.&nbsp;</span></li> <li><b>Economic uncertainty:</b> <span>Tariff talks, layoffs, and federal policy changes are among the other </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/19/business/fed-meeting-minutes-interest-rates.html"><span>factors</span></a><span> dampening homebuyer demand. A recent Redfin</span> <a href="https://www.redfin.com/news/survey-tariffs-major-purchase/"><span>survey</span></a> <span>found that nearly 1 in 4 Americans is scrapping plans to make a major purchase due to tariffs.&nbsp;</span></li> <li><b>The mortgage rate lock-in effect is easing:</b><span> Homeowners who have been sitting on ultra-low mortgage rates they scored during the pandemic are now </span><a href="https://www.redfin.com/news/mortgage-rate-lock-in-effect-eases/"><span>giving up</span></a><span> those low rates and selling their homes. That&rsquo;s because for most people, it&rsquo;s not realistic to stay put forever; job changes, return to office mandates and divorce force people to move. The idea of taking on a higher mortgage rate also isn&rsquo;t as shocking as it was when rates first skyrocketed in 2022.&nbsp;</span></li> </ul><p><span>&ldquo;The balance of power in the U.S. housing market has shifted toward buyers, but a lot of sellers have yet to see or accept the writing on the wall. Many are still holding out hope that their home is the exception and will fetch top dollar,&rdquo; said Redfin Senior Economist </span><a href="https://www.redfin.com/news/author/asad-khan/"><span>Asad Khan</span></a><span>. &ldquo;But as sellers see their homes sit longer on the market and notice fewer buyers coming through on tour, more of them will realize that the market has adjusted and reset their expectations accordingly.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span>Sellers are already gaining more data points on this front, and will likely face another reality&nbsp; check in the summer, when demand typically starts to slow. More than two of every five (44%) home listings in April had been on the market for 60 days or longer&mdash;the highest April share since 2020. Stale inventory is piling up in part because many sellers are overpricing their homes, using sky-high comps from the recent seller&rsquo;s market that aren&rsquo;t realistic today. In some cases, sellers are pricing high because they bought at the peak of the market and are trying to recoup their investment.&nbsp;</span></p><p><b>The takeaway for sellers:</b><span> Time is not on your side. If you are considering selling, do it sooner rather than later because home prices in your area may fall. If your home is already on the market and has been sitting for over a month, you may want to consider an improvement to your property or a reduction in price.</span></p><p><b>The takeaway for buyers: </b><span>Many Americans have already been and will remain priced out of the housing market, even if prices decline. But for those who are still in the game, don&rsquo;t get discouraged. Your purchasing power will increase if home prices fall, </span><a href="https://www.atlantafed.org/chcs/wage-growth-tracker"><span>wages</span></a><span> rise and mortgage rates remain steady as </span><a href="https://www.redfin.com/news/home-price-forecast-decline-2025/"><span>expected</span></a><span>. Homes that would have been out of reach six months ago may come into reach as sellers entertain lower offers and concessions.</span></p><h3><b>History Shows That Home Prices Cool When Sellers Outnumber Buyers</b></h3><p><span><br> A change in the balance of buyers and sellers is a signal of what&rsquo;s to come with home prices. Aside from the onset of the pandemic, the last time sellers significantly outnumbered buyers was around the time mortgage rates jumped in 2018.</span></p><p><span>In November 2018, the average 30-year-fixed mortgage rate peaked at 4.87%, which was the highest level in nearly eight years and almost a full percentage point higher than a year earlier. One month later, sellers outnumbered buyers by 9.4%&mdash;the largest percentage since 2015 and a reversal from the prior year, when buyers outnumbered sellers. Three months later, home-price growth shrunk to the lowest level in at least six years, with prices rising 2% from a year earlier to $283,912.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>We saw a similar dynamic take hold in 2013-2014. As shown in the chart below, swings in the ratio of buyers to sellers are typically followed by similar swings in home-price growth.</span></p><p><span>Today, the imbalance between buyers and sellers is even greater, meaning there&rsquo;s more pressure on prices. Annual price growth has already slowed to 1.6% from 6.2% last spring, and we expect this trajectory to continue, ultimately causing prices to fall. The last time home prices posted a year-over-year decline was 2023.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Even as mortgage rates surged in 2022, buyers outnumbered sellers. Sellers most recently started outnumbering buyers in November 2023&mdash;the month after mortgage rates hit the highest level in over two decades, peaking at almost 8%. Homebuyer demand has been sluggish ever since, and is likely to remain so given widespread economic uncertainty and recession fears. What</span><i><span> has</span></i><span> changed recently is more sellers have started entering the market.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><b>Miami and West Palm Beach Are the Strongest Buyer&rsquo;s Markets, With Nearly Three Times More Sellers Than Buyers</b></h3><p><span><br> In </span><a href="https://www.redfin.com/city/11458/FL/Miami"><span>Miami</span></a><span>, there are an estimated 21,672 home sellers and 7,280 homebuyers. That means there are 197.7% more sellers than buyers&mdash;the largest imbalance among the 50 most populous U.S. metropolitan areas. It&rsquo;s followed by </span><a href="https://www.redfin.com/city/19373/FL/West-Palm-Beach"><span>West Palm Beach, FL</span></a><span> (182% more sellers than buyers), </span><a href="https://www.redfin.com/city/6173/FL/Fort-Lauderdale"><span>Fort Lauderdale, FL</span></a><span> (179.3%), </span><a href="https://www.redfin.com/city/30818/TX/Austin"><span>Austin, TX</span></a><span> (124.1%) and </span><a href="https://www.redfin.com/city/8907/FL/Jacksonville"><span>Jacksonville, FL</span></a><span> (119.5%).</span></p><p><span>In this report, we define a market where there are over 10% more sellers than buyers as a buyer&rsquo;s market and a market where there are over 10% fewer sellers than buyers as a seller&rsquo;s market. A market where the gap is plus or minus 10% is considered a balanced market.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Overall, 31 of the 50 most populous metros are buyer&rsquo;s markets, 12 are balanced markets and seven are seller&rsquo;s markets. The buyer&rsquo;s markets are concentrated in the Sun Belt and on the West Coast, while balanced markets and seller&rsquo;s markets skew more toward the Midwest and East Coast.

At the same time, listings are rising, mirroring the national trend. Together, these forces are creating a balanced market. In Chicago, demand is weak, mirroring the national trend. But inventory is also weak, which creates balance in another way.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span>There are just seven seller&rsquo;s markets. Newark, NJ is the strongest seller&rsquo;s market, with an estimated 5,241 sellers and 9,899 buyers&mdash;or 47.1% fewer sellers than buyers. This imbalance helped Newark home sellers fetch record-high prices last month; the metro&rsquo;s median sale price rose 12.2% from a year earlier&mdash;the biggest gain among the top 50 metros.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The other seller&rsquo;s markets are Nassau County, NY (41.7% fewer sellers than buyers), Montgomery County, PA (38.4% fewer), Cleveland (24.8%), New Brunswick, NJ (18.6%), Providence, RI (16.1%) and Baltimore (11.8%).&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>New construction can have a significant influence on whether negotiating power lies with buyers or sellers because it impacts the balance of supply and demand.

Analogously, we estimated what fraction of buyers on the market will find a home within a given month using Redfin data on the typical time from first tour to purchase. The ratio of these two data points approximates the ratio of buyers to sellers in the market. We then multiplied that ratio by the number of active listings to get the estimated total number of buyers in the market. Note that our estimate of buyers is not based on Redfin traffic or customer acquisition data, and the purpose of this analysis is to measure the number of buyers and sellers in the housing market as a whole. All metrics that go into our calculation of the number of buyers and sellers in the market are seasonally adjusted.</span></p><p><span>References:</span><span><br> </span><span>Anenberg, Elliot and Daniel Ringo, &ldquo;Volatility in home sales and prices: supply or demand?&rdquo; Journal of Urban Economics, Vol. 139, January 2024, 103610.</span><span><br> </span><span>Genesove, David and Lu Han, &ldquo;Search and matching in the housing market,&rdquo; Journal of Urban Economics, Vol. 72, Issue 1, July 2012, pp. 21-45.</span></p></div><div><figure><img src="https://www.redfin.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Lily_Katz-300x300.jpg" alt="Lily Katz"></figure><div><h4><a href="https://www.redfin.com/news/author/lily-katzredfin-com/">Lily Katz</a></h4><p>As a data journalist, Lily is passionate about helping readers understand complex facets of the housing market.

Countless farmers from across the state came to voice their concerns about the current state of farming.</p><p>Representatives from U.S. Congressman Rick Crawford, Sen. Tom Cotton, and Sen. John Boozman&rsquo;s offices attended the gathering to hear concerns.</p><p>One of the farmers in attendance, Chris King, spoke about his harvest difficulties.</p><p>He told us this was his 39th harvest, and he has never seen it this bad before. </p><p>&ldquo;I have never been as worried as I am now about whether or not my kids and grandkids will be able to carry on,&rdquo; said Chris King.</p><h3>Lack of profit, export difficulties, and high costs</h3><p>Chris King said the main problem is that they can&rsquo;t sell for profit. </p><p>&ldquo;I just would like to see somebody help us get our markets back,&rdquo; said Chris King. &ldquo;We need our exports, and we just need to be paid for what we do, and that&rsquo;s not happening, and we&rsquo;re in real trouble.&rdquo;</p><p>But this is not the only issue.</p><p>Chris King&rsquo;s wife, Melissa King, and farmer Scott Brown said they are struggling to afford the bare minimum cost to maintain their farms.</p><p>&ldquo;Prices that we are getting now are prices like they were when we were children, and what it costs for us to farm is astronomical now. The price of a combine when we were kids was in the 20,000s, and now it&rsquo;s 100,000,&rdquo; said Melissa King.</p><p>&ldquo;I farm 800 acres by myself, I can&rsquo;t afford any help, I farm with paid-for equipment, all my tractors are 50 years old, and I can&rsquo;t hardly make this deal work,&rdquo; said Brown. &ldquo;How are the guys farming 5 and 10 thousand with 20 hands and million-dollar combines and million-dollar drills going to make it work?&rdquo;</p><h3>Tariffs are hurting farmers</h3><p>Brown said one issue that rounds out all the problems farmers are facing: tariffs.</p><p>&ldquo;I think the tariffs are the ice cream on the cake of a perfect storm,&rdquo; said Brown. &ldquo;When you try and sell a product, okay, U.S. soybeans leaving New Orleans without the tariff to China are cheaper than Brazilian soybeans, at the current market. But when you put the tariff on top of them, Brazilian beans are cheaper.&rdquo; </p><p>What can be done to help farmers? </p><p>&ldquo;In the short term, they have no choice but to mail us a check,&rdquo; said Brown. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know a farmer that likes the check program. Nobody wants to take the taxpayer dollars, but nobody wants to go broke, nobody wants to lose everything. Long term, we have to have options, markets, and places to sell our product.&rdquo; </p><p>The political representatives who attended said they will take these concerns to Washington to share with government leaders and find a way to solve this problem before it&rsquo;s too late.</p><p><i>To report a typo or correction, please </i><a href="https://www.kait8.com/page/tips/"><i>click here</i></a><i>.</i></p><p><i>Copyright 2025 KAIT.

(KATV) &mdash; </span>Hundreds of struggling Arkansas farmers are pleading with the federal government to provide emergency funding amid a farm economy crisis.</p><p>Almost everything that could go wrong for Arkansas farmers went wrong this year, leaving many facing bankruptcy or even the closure of farms that have been passed down for generations.</p><p>A dismal global market and plunging commodity prices mean there&rsquo;s little hope of breaking even, even as input costs soar because of inflation and tariffs&mdash;on top of bad weather earlier in the year.</p><p>&ldquo;This time last year, the rice price was about 40 percent higher than it is now. Inputs costs have gone up, fertilizer has gone up, commodity prices have gotten worse. So, after a horrible year last year where most farmers in Arkansas, Delta, lost money, this year is going to be worse,&rdquo; said Derek Haigwood, a farmer from Independence and Jackson county.</p><p>Though President Trump&rsquo;s &ldquo;Big, Beautiful Bill&rdquo; provided a much-needed update to safety net subsidies for farmers, they won&rsquo;t see those federal dollars until late next year. By then, some have projected that as many as one-fourth&mdash;or even one-third&mdash;of Arkansas farmers could face bankruptcy or be forced out of business.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a sixth-generation farmer from Newport, and we made the decision to go out this year, in the spring. So, my son will not be the seventh generation on our farm,&rdquo; said one Newport farmer.</p><p>&ldquo;In the last 14 months, five of my customers have committed suicide. That&rsquo;s how serious this is,&rdquo; said another Arkansas farmer who also works as an ag equipment financier.</p><p>On Tuesday, farmers gathered in Brookland to share their struggles with staffers from Arkansas&rsquo; congressional delegation, asking the state's representatives on Capitol Hill and the governor to convince the president to provide emergency aid to see them through to next year.</p><p>&ldquo;We have to have ad hoc payments right now to make it through this year,&rdquo; Haigwood said.</p><p>&ldquo;If there&rsquo;s no emergency funding this year, there will be one out of three farmers who will file bankruptcy,&rdquo; said Chris King, a Woodruff County farmer.</p><p>Their cries for help did not appear to fall on deaf ears.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to take your message. We&rsquo;re going to get it back to D.C. and we&rsquo;re going to do everything we can to get you the help you need,&rdquo; said Gene Higginbotham, district director for Congressman Rick Crawford.</p><p>Until then, farmers have no one to turn to but God.</p><p>&ldquo;Farmers, in my opinion, dear Lord, they&rsquo;re closer to you than anyone else on this earth because we deal with your earth every day. Dear Lord, we&rsquo;re hurting, dear Lord. We can&rsquo;t help what&rsquo;s happened to us. We need help, dear Lord,&rdquo; prayed one farmer at Tuesday's meeting.</p></div></section>]]></description><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2025 00:45:38 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://apnews.com/article/conocophillips-layoffs-job-cuts-2025-f35528aad7d8c02895853d73bb12842e?&amp;&amp;&amp;</link><title>ConocoPhillips says it will lay off up to 25% of its workforce, impacting thousands of jobs (apnews.com)</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/1n7vzsa/conocophillips_says_it_will_lay_off_up_to_25_of/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/1n7vzsa/conocophillips_says_it_will_lay_off_up_to_25_of/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p>Reading time: 6 min | <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/1n7vzsa/conocophillips_says_it_will_lay_off_up_to_25_of/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='preview-image'><img src='https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/152a20c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5184x2916+0+270/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F38%2F20%2F15c9e8af8101f627af72d167469a%2Fac3927b5b5c040128dafa8340892b868' /></section><section class='parsed-content'><div xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><div><p></p></div><bsp-page-actions> </bsp-page-actions> </div><div xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><p>NEW YORK (AP) &mdash; Oil giant ConocoPhillips is planning to lay off up to a quarter of its workforce, amounting to thousands of jobs, as part of broader efforts from the company to cut costs.</p><p>A spokesperson for ConocoPhillips confirmed the layoffs on Wednesday, noting that 20% to 25% of the company&rsquo;s employees and contractors would be impacted worldwide.

However, it can still provide a good sense of underlying trends: Like most economic metrics, JOLTS is meant to be viewed and analyzed in concert with other data. </p><p>Wednesday&rsquo;s JOLTS report is the first of several major labor market data releases due out in this holiday-abbreviated week, culminating with the August jobs report on Friday. Economists expect job gains to remain fairly tepid, at 80,000, and the unemployment rate to hold steady at 4.2%, according to FactSet estimates. </p><p>&ldquo;What I was really looking for (in the JOLTS data) was for any revisions, because we had those huge revisions<strong> </strong>[to the May and June jobs reports]<strong> </strong>but that was not the case,&rdquo; Dan North, senior economist for North America at Allianz Trade, told CNN in an interview. &ldquo;Certainly, I think the employment report on Friday is the more important number. We&rsquo;ll be looking for what the revisions are, because those last two months were pretty shocking, and we expect this month to be light again, similar to what we had last month.&rdquo; </p><p>Wednesday&rsquo;s data is yet another sign that the labor market isn&rsquo;t just cooling, it has grown stale: Hiring remained stagnant, workers stayed put and layoffs remained low. </p><p>The all-important turnover needed for a healthy labor market has become all but nonexistent. </p><p>The July JOLTS data &ldquo;offers a good reminder of why labor market churn matters: It can help drive up wages, create more opportunities for a broader range of workers to enter the market, and support innovation,&rdquo; Allison Shrivastava, an economist at employment site Indeed, wrote Wednesday. &ldquo;For the past few months, the opposite has largely held true.&rdquo; </p><p>In addition to being less dynamic, the job market has become increasingly reliant upon a select few industries &mdash; primarily health care, with leisure and hospitality to a lesser extent &mdash; to drive overall employment growth. However, even opportunities within those industries appear to be shrinking. </p><p>Job openings fell the most in health care and social assistance in July and also dipped somewhat in leisure and hospitality, Wednesday&rsquo;s data showed. </p><p>Openings picked up the most in wholesale trade, construction and the federal government (where areas such as immigration enforcement are on a hiring spree while other agencies are trying to claw back workers after the Trump administration&rsquo;s deep workforce cuts). </p><p>Wednesday&rsquo;s report also showed that hiring was flat across most sectors (including health care and the federal government).
