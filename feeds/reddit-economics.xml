Participation rates dropped by ~10% from 2000 to 2010, and have remained in the high-50s since then. A secondary reason of &#39;disability&#39; for remaining out of the workforce uses data from a different cohort (even though a closer cohort is available) that actually shows a drop in disability, which only accounts for 3% of non-participants or ~1.5% of the cohort of men.</p><p>By the same author in the (somewhat better, with data) linked article: &quot;while young men are outperforming previous generations by several measures, they continue to face challenges, especially in labor force participation&quot;</p><p><a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/gen-z-men-at-work-10-facts-about-young-mens-employment-trends/">https://www.americanprogress.org/article/gen-z-men-at-work-10-facts-about-young-mens-employment-trends/</a></p><p>Keep in mind many charts in the underlying article are not zero-based on the Y axis, and some of the conclusions are contradicted by the data provided immediately below. (e.g. &quot;Young men&#39;s unemployment has grown swiftly in 2025&quot; with data then showing that unemployment went from 11% to 10.6%, and is lower than almost any period in the past 35 years).</p><p>I get the feeling that this article was written by the author to drive traffic to the study by the same author, and uses language like &#39;surprise&#39;  &#39;GenZ&#39; and &#39;crisis&#39; for clicks, when by their own research this indicator has been steady for a generation, therefore neither a surprise nor specific to GenZ, and certainly not a recent &#39;crisis&#39; as described. </p><p>The author states young labor force participation is a &quot;growing concern&quot; but this would be at the expense of schooling, even vocational school that the author&#39;s data shows has increased recently while at the same time calling for more training. Reasonable people can disagree whether this is good long or short term for the economy, but it&#39;s a discussion they never seem to get to.</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/1nlx6mm/gen_z_men_are_facing_a_surprise_workforce_crisis/nf9exim/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><div class="md"><p>The article touches on this somewhat, but since people don&#39;t read: kids don&#39;t work while they&#39;re in school as much anymore. Women aren&#39;t having babies at the same rate and certainly not as frequently in their teens and early twenties. And when they do, they often still work.</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/1nlx6mm/gen_z_men_are_facing_a_surprise_workforce_crisis/nf9fifl/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><div class="md"><p>This article seems to suggest that for whatever reason, encouraging more GenZ men to work is the magic that will make the economy thrive. That there are vast swaths of jobs just going begging. Maybe there are, but are they &quot;good&quot; jobs or shit ones? </p><p>Ultimately, are there actual job openings for them in fields that match their education levels and provide some kind of satisfaction? Is this that cart/horse conundrum thing? </p><p>One thing about millennials and younger is that they have thrown the bullshit flag on spending their lives working a job that makes them miserable for slave wage pay. We are not as religious as we used to be, so you can&#39;t just say &quot;My life is misery now but once I cast off this mortal coil  I will go to Heaven and be rewarded in the afterlife&quot;. That dog doesn&#39;t hunt. Sorry if anyone religious takes offence but its where we are at. Also, the &quot;Bootstraps&quot; argument is a load of crap too. </p><p>Long story short is many of the younger generations are aware the game is somewhat rigged.

Now you can buy fractional stocks whether you are in the us, India or Latin America. So while I think that fundamentally it’s the same issue as previous bubbles, the difference now is that the ceiling will be higher due to basically way more players in the markets.</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/1nljnbs/the_stock_market_flashes_a_warning_seen_during/nf63dnp/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><div class="md"><p>While this is bad, and obviously the disastrous GOP policies are leading to a cooling economy+ high inflation, I&#39;ve lost quite a bit of faith that people will wise up, start caring about politics, realize that &quot;Oh, I&#39;m apolitical&quot; is stupid, and vote properly.</p><p>People say the economy is the most important thing. I disagree. If the economy is the most important thing, then most states would be swing states, but they&#39;re not. When people say the economy is the most important thing, they mean that within a specific set of parameters, and that&#39;s culture issues. The economy is only important in the 7 swing states. Yeah the culture wars are mostly bs, but they exist and that&#39;s the reality, and people just care way more about invisible haitians eating dogs and trans people in bathrooms and &quot;strong vibes&quot; rather than the economy.</p><p>Even if a D president gets elected, they&#39;ll have an extremely divided Congress to work with, won&#39;t be able to pass genuine big structural reform, get all the people mad, and vote GOP again, then complain when things get bad. People love split ticket voting or abstaining because they&#39;re angry with the president but will vote GOP down ballot or whatever and will then proudly champion how &quot;bipartisan and smart&quot; they are. Republican voters might even get angry with the President(although Trump&#39;s as popular with the MAGA cult as ever) but its literally the &quot;One Bad Man&quot; theory where they&#39;ll continue voting GOP in state and Congressional elections.</p><p>In 1932, almost all the states voted FDR, gave Democrats a 200 seat House majority, a 30 seat Senate majority, and most Governorships in the country went D too. Today, the Governorships would barely change, the State legislatures would remain the same, and a D president will barely get elected and have a super divided Congress to work with.</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/1nljnbs/the_stock_market_flashes_a_warning_seen_during/nf5zkur/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><div class="md"><p><strong>- Key points</strong></p><ul><li>As of July 2025, the cape ratio stood at 37.8, compared with long term average of 17, close to the dot com bubble&#39;s CAPE ratio of 44</li><li>CAPE ratio is similar to PE ratio but adjusts for economic cycles</li></ul><p><strong>- For those with more time:</strong></p><p><strong>So what&#39;s the issue?</strong></p><p>There&#39;s debate around whether the <strong>current elevated value of the ratio</strong> is an <strong>early warning sign of a market correction</strong>, as it happened in 1929 and the dotcom era of 1990s.</p><p><strong>What is a CAPE ratio?</strong></p><p><strong>The CAPE ratio assesses whether the market is undervalued or overvalued.</strong> It is similar to the PE ratio - it compares stock price to earnings, howeverunlike the PE ratio, it averages earnings over 10 years to adjust for economic cycles. </p><p><strong>Why use the CAPE ratio?

Accountability for and taxes on the wealthy have been slashed since then, so it&#39;s hardly shocking that we have a 2 tier economy and embarassingly horrific inequality.</p><p>That was the point; funnel as much of the benefits to the top. It wasn&#39;t some fluke. They knew trickle down didn&#39;t work, but this propaganda which is even more extreme today, was designed and implemented for this exact outcome. The plan was an extraordinary success but the wish list still isn&#39;t complete. Project 2025 goals defines most of that. Left unchecked, these people&#39;s aggression will not end. It&#39;s up to the public to stop it. But how bad will things get before then?</p><p>Today orruption abounds and leadership for both parties, brazen and aggressively by one more than the other, caters to the top. A 2 tier justice system has always existed in the country. Most of government has been captured by rent seekers. These discrepancies can be found in court cases, economic data, and anecdotes from every day lives of Americans. Maybe those records will be deleted or whitewashed like government records on terrorism that were deleted this week, or shutdown through censorship that&#39;s ongoing.</p><p>The country&#39;s leaders and millions of uneducated, highly persuadable voters have completely dismissed the idea of democracy altogether and we march down the path of fascism. Yes men replace anyone in the way of personal agendas and grift. We&#39;re always at war or involved with them. We&#39;ve seemingly returned to the time of kings and religion as a state prop.</p><p>Powell sees the writing on the wall. Anyone can observe the points his made and will see an unstable future ahead if they&#39;re honest with themselves. Even this relatively independent institution has been or is being captured now. I think of a cartoon picture I saw where &quot;small government&quot; is promoted and the frames progress from left with checks and balances, to the right with 1 man in control of everything. The country has abandoned everything it was supposed to stand for.</p><p>I&#39;m still optimistic for the country, but to rediscover and motivate the public to return to our idea of &quot;dream,&quot; a lot more suffering is going to take place before then. This feels like opening innings into a dark period ahead.</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/1njyym9/jerome_powell_on_signs_of_an_ai_bubble_and_an/nevx86l/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p></li></ol></section>]]></description><pubDate>Thu, 18 Sep 2025 10:05:23 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/17/opinion/trump-economy-deportation-inflation.html?unlocked_article_code=1.m08.MDSj.AzwNv8eC_SAJ</link><title>The Trump Fantasy Is Unraveling (nytimes.com)</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/1njyj44/the_trump_fantasy_is_unraveling/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/1njyj44/the_trump_fantasy_is_unraveling/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/1njyj44/the_trump_fantasy_is_unraveling/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='separator separator-before-comments'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='comments'><p>Top comments</p><ol><li><div class="md"><p>Listen, we should not expect, nor count on, Trump supporters <em>ever</em> admitting fault, or changing direction.

One of the key aspects of this strategy is economic pressure on the population, which, in their opinion, contributes to a decrease in the well-being of citizens and, as a result, a decrease in their ability to resist and defend their rights.</p><p>According to this hypothesis, economic measures aimed at reducing the income of the population and increasing poverty can lead to a decrease in the level of education and overall social mobility. This, in turn, can create conditions for more effective manipulation of public opinion and control over the behavior of citizens. Thus, it is assumed that the poor and less educated segments of the population will be less able to organize mass protests and overthrow the existing political regime.</p><p>This approach is based on the assumption that economic instability and social inequality are factors contributing to the strengthening of authoritarian tendencies in politics. However, it is worth noting that this hypothesis requires further empirical research and analysis to confirm or refute its validity.</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/1njyj44/the_trump_fantasy_is_unraveling/neyqaz2/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><div class="md"><p>Thanks for sharing the article.

Accounts that are likely to get banks in legal hot water are bad for business.  Large crypto holders are more likely to fall in this category so they get flagged for extra scrutiny.  Sometimes banks decide this extra scrutiny is going to cost more than it&#39;s worth and just preemptively cancel the accounts.  If a new law goes into effect saying you can&#39;t cancel an account over politics, all these crypto bros have a new legal avenue to challenge their account cancellation.

But we can&#39;t downplay how employers don’t seem to value degrees the way they used to. Tech layoffs, automation creeping into professional tasks, even government cutbacks; that’s where the real shift is.</p><p>And this isn&#39;t even a new trend, hasn’t the “college premium” been shrinking for years? The “college premium” was based on scarce skills. Once degrees became common and tasks got automated, the scarcity disappeared. That’s why the payoff is shrinking. Feels like the story here isn’t just cyclical weakness but a deeper restructuring of what counts as “skilled” work.</p><p>If that’s true, the question isn’t “why are grads struggling now?” We should be asking whether the degree itself is losing its long-term payoff. It&#39;s hard to say if the demand for the skills of these college graduates are going to rebound with our current direction in AI and tech.
