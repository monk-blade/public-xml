The visa fee for skilled workers would jump from $215. The fee for investor visas, which are common in many European countries, would climb from $10,000-$20,000 a year. </p><p>H-1B visas, which require at least a bachelor&rsquo;s degree, are meant for high-skilled jobs that tech companies find difficult to fill. Critics say the program is a pipeline for overseas workers who are often willing to work for as little as $60,000 annually, well below the $100,000-plus salaries typically paid to U.S. technology workers.</p><p>Trump on Friday insisted that the tech industry would not oppose the move. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said &ldquo;all big companies&rdquo; are on board.</p><p>Representatives for the biggest tech companies, including Amazon, Apple, Google and Meta, did not immediately respond to messages for comment on Friday. Microsoft declined to comment.</p><p>Lutnick said the change will likely result in far fewer H-1B visas than the 85,000 annual cap allows because &ldquo;it&rsquo;s just not economic anymore.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re going to train people, you&rsquo;re going to train Americans.&rdquo; Lutnick said on a conference call with reporters. &ldquo;If you have a very sophisticated engineer and you want to bring them in ... then you can pay $100,000 a year for your H-1B visa.&rdquo; </p><p>Trump also announced he will <span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-gold-card-visa-million-investors-1aa4585dc053e21c7d887f1fdb9eec13">start selling a &ldquo;gold card&rdquo; visa</a></span> with a path to U.S. citizenship for $1 million after vetting. For companies, it will cost $2 million to sponsor an employee. </p><p>The &ldquo;Trump Platinum Card&rdquo; will be available for a $5 million and allow foreigners to spend up to 270 days in the U.S. without being subject to U.S. taxes on non-U.S. income. Trump announced a $5 million gold card in February to replace an existing investor visa &mdash; this is now the platinum card.</p><p>Lutnick said the gold and platinum cards would replace employment-based visas that offer paths to citizenship, including for professors, scientists, artists and athletes.</p><p>Critics of H-1Bs visas who say they are used to replace American workers applauded the move. U.S. Tech Workers, an advocacy group, called it &ldquo;the next best thing&rdquo; to abolishing the visas altogether.</p><p>Doug Rand, a senior official at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services during the Biden administration, said the proposed fee increase was &ldquo;ludicrously lawless.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t real policy &mdash; it&rsquo;s fan service for immigration restrictionists,&rdquo; Rand said. &ldquo;Trump gets his headlines, and inflicts a jolt of panic, and doesn&rsquo;t care whether this survives first contact with the courts.&rdquo; </p><p>Lutnick said the H-1B fees and gold card could be introduced by the president but the platinum card needs congressional approval. </p><p>Historically, H-1B visas have been doled out through lottery. This year, Amazon was by far the top recipient of H-1B visas with more than 10,000 awarded, followed by Tata Consultancy, Microsoft, Apple and Google. Geographically, California has the highest number of H-1B workers.</p><p>Critics say H-1B spots often go to entry-level jobs, rather than senior positions with unique skill requirements. And while the program isn&rsquo;t supposed to undercut U.S. wages or displace U.S. workers, critics say companies can pay less by classifying jobs at the lowest skill levels, even if the specific workers hired have more experience.</p><p>As a result, many U.S. companies find it cheaper to contract out help desks, programming and other basic tasks to consulting companies such as Wipro, Infosys, HCL Technologies and Tata in India and IBM and Cognizant in the U.S. These consulting companies hire foreign workers, often from India, and contract them out to U.S. employers looking to save money.</p><p>First lady Melania Trump, the former Melania Knauss, was granted an H-1B work visa in October 1996 to work as a model. She was born in Slovenia.</p><p>In 2024, lottery bids for the visas plunged nearly 40%, which authorities said was due to success against people who were &ldquo;gaming the system&rdquo; by submitting multiple, sometimes dubious, applications to unfairly increase chances of being selected.</p><p>Major technology companies that use H-1B visas sought changes after massive increases in bids left their employees and prospective hires with slimmer chances of winning the random lottery. Facing what it acknowledged was likely fraud and abuse, USCIS this year said each employee had only one shot at the lottery, whether the person had one job offer or 50.</p><p>Critics welcomed the change but said more needs to be done. The AFL-CIO wrote last year that while changes to the lottery &ldquo;included some steps in the right direction,&rdquo; it fell short of needed reforms. The labor group wants visas awarded to companies that pay the highest wages instead of by random lottery, a change that Trump sought during his first term in the White House.</p><p>___</p><p>Ortutay reported from Oakland, Calif.

Roughly 70% of U.S. economic growth <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/can-rich-continue-prop-up-us-consumer-spending-2025-08-18/#:~:text=In%20the%20U.S.%2C%20%22the%20consumer,the%20health%20of%20the%20economy.">comes from</a> consumer spending, yet most households <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/2025-rise-americans-living-paycheck-2128753">live</a> paycheck to paycheck. That demand picture has taken on a shape that analysts call&nbsp; K-shaped: while many families cut back on essentials, wealthier households continue to spend on travel, tech, and luxury goods&mdash;and they continued to do so in August. For now, the inflation recovery depends heavily on this dynamic remaining in fragile stasis. It&rsquo;s a fix that works well until it doesn&rsquo;t, if it could be described as working at all.</p><p>&ldquo;[Spending] may well be skewed toward higher-earning consumers,&rdquo; Powell told reporters after the Fed&rsquo;s latest policy meeting. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot of anecdotal evidence to suggest that.&rdquo; </p></div><p>That skew has become increasingly obvious in markets. Just seven firms &mdash; <a href="https://fortune.com/company/microsoft/">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://fortune.com/company/nvidia/">Nvidia</a>, <a href="https://fortune.com/company/apple/">Apple</a>, <a href="https://fortune.com/company/alphabet/">Alphabet</a>, <a href="https://fortune.com/company/facebook/">Meta</a>, <a href="https://fortune.com/company/amazon-com/">Amazon</a>, and <a href="https://fortune.com/company/tesla/">Tesla</a> &mdash; now make up <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor-hub/article/sp-500-weight-mag-7-stocks-diversification-risk/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">more than 30%</a> of the S&amp;P 500&rsquo;s value. Their relentless AI capex is keeping business investment positive, even as overall job growth has slowed to a crawl. Goldman Sachs <a href="https://fortune.com/2025/09/09/sp-500-capex-ai-share-buybacks-goldman-sachs/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">estimates</a> AI spending accounted for nearly all of the 7% year-over-year gain in corporate capex this spring.</p><p>The comments underscore a widening concern at the Fed: that while headline GDP growth is holding above 1.5%, the composition of that growth is uneven, unlike previous booms in housing or manufacturing.&nbsp; </p><p>Powell pointed to &ldquo;kids coming out of college and younger people, minorities&rdquo; as <a href="https://fortune.com/2025/09/17/jerome-powell-says-gen-z-hiring-nightmare-college-kids-hard-time/">struggling</a> to find jobs in today&rsquo;s cooling labor market, even as affluent households continue to spend freely and companies funnel cash into cutting-edge technologies. </p><p>The imbalance reflects what Powell described as &ldquo;a low firing, low hiring environment,&rdquo; where layoffs remain rare but job creation has slowed to a crawl. That dynamic, combined with the concentration of economic gains in AI and among the wealthy, risks deepening inequality, and complicates the Fed&rsquo;s attempt to balance its inflation and employment mandates. </p><p>That disconnect risks widening the gap between Wall Street and Main Street. While affluent households continue to spend freely and tech titans pour billions into data centers and chips, revised jobs data show the economy added just 22,000 positions in August, with unemployment edging up to 4.3%. </p><div><p>&ldquo;Unusually large&rdquo; AI investment may sustain top-line growth, Powell suggested, but it&rsquo;s doing little to lift the broad labor market.</p><p>&ldquo;The overall job finding rate is very, very low,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If layoffs begin to rise, there won&rsquo;t be a lot of hiring going on.&rdquo;</p></div></div><p><strong>Fortune Global Forum</strong> returns Oct. 26&ndash;27, 2025 in Riyadh.

Both Cook and Miran took part in Wednesday&rsquo;s vote in which the Fed <span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/federal-reserve-inflation-trump-2d05401d7c9cb2393925f494aac71d89">cut its key interest</a></span> rate by a quarter-point. </p><p>The next opportunity for Cook to cast a vote will be at the meeting of the Fed&rsquo;s interest rate setting committee, scheduled for Oct. 28-29.</p><p>Trump <span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/federal-reserve-cook-trump-308f2e6ac04f62643d96b8347d5b2417">sought to fire Cook</a></span> on Aug. 25, but a federal judge ruled last week that the removal probably was illegal and <span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/federal-reserve-governor-lisa-cook-trump-firing-651fcf0637cf14901bbd559df00c856b">reinstated her</a></span> to the Fed&rsquo;s board. Trump has accused Cook of mortgage fraud because she appeared to claim two properties, in Michigan and Georgia, as &ldquo;primary residences&rdquo; in June and July 2021, before she joined the board. Such claims can lead to a lower mortgage rate and smaller down payment than if one of them was declared as a rental property or second home. </p><p>&ldquo;Put simply, the President may reasonably determine that interest rates paid by the American people should not be set by a Governor who appears to have lied about facts material to the interest rates she secured for herself &mdash; and refuses to explain the apparent misrepresentations,&rdquo; Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in his Supreme Court filing.</p><p>But Cook has denied any wrongdoing and has not been charged with a crime. According to documents <span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/federal-reserve-lisa-cook-trump-852820c83e5001ec3b6e2d14047965c9">obtained by The Associated Press</a></span>, Cook did specify that her Atlanta condo would be a &ldquo;vacation home,&rdquo; according to a loan estimate she obtained in May 2021. And in a form seeking a security clearance, she described it as a &ldquo;2nd home.&rdquo; Both documents appear to undercut the Trump administration&rsquo;s claims of fraud. </p><p>U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb ruled that the administration <span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/federal-reserve-governor-lisa-cook-trump-firing-651fcf0637cf14901bbd559df00c856b">had not satisfied a legal requirement</a></span> that Fed governors can only be fired &ldquo;for cause,&rdquo; which she said was limited to misconduct while in office. Cook did not join the Fed&rsquo;s board until 2022. </p><div><bsp-figure> <figure> <a></a><picture> <source width="800" height="533" srcset="https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/e5bfb79/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5400x3600+0+0/resize/800x533!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2Fcc%2Fed%2F0174f24b867f4b6532b1b09745b9%2F9ba952c0838c4d4c90d4fc12bc578d08 1x,https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/25ed0bf/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5400x3600+0+0/resize/1600x1066!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2Fcc%2Fed%2F0174f24b867f4b6532b1b09745b9%2F9ba952c0838c4d4c90d4fc12bc578d08 2x"> <source width="800" height="533" srcset="https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/b30c6df/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5400x3600+0+0/resize/800x533!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2Fcc%2Fed%2F0174f24b867f4b6532b1b09745b9%2F9ba952c0838c4d4c90d4fc12bc578d08 1x,https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/f00086b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5400x3600+0+0/resize/1600x1066!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2Fcc%2Fed%2F0174f24b867f4b6532b1b09745b9%2F9ba952c0838c4d4c90d4fc12bc578d08 2x"> <source width="767" height="511" srcset="https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/4972815/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5400x3600+0+0/resize/767x511!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2Fcc%2Fed%2F0174f24b867f4b6532b1b09745b9%2F9ba952c0838c4d4c90d4fc12bc578d08 1x,https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/2a97acd/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5400x3600+0+0/resize/1534x1022!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2Fcc%2Fed%2F0174f24b867f4b6532b1b09745b9%2F9ba952c0838c4d4c90d4fc12bc578d08 2x"> <source width="767" height="511" srcset="https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/afa4b19/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5400x3600+0+0/resize/767x511!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2Fcc%2Fed%2F0174f24b867f4b6532b1b09745b9%2F9ba952c0838c4d4c90d4fc12bc578d08 1x,https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/de665dc/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5400x3600+0+0/resize/1534x1022!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2Fcc%2Fed%2F0174f24b867f4b6532b1b09745b9%2F9ba952c0838c4d4c90d4fc12bc578d08 2x"> <source width="599" height="399" srcset="https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/6cd1caf/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5400x3600+0+0/resize/599x399!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2Fcc%2Fed%2F0174f24b867f4b6532b1b09745b9%2F9ba952c0838c4d4c90d4fc12bc578d08 1x,https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/3f44561/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5400x3600+0+0/resize/1198x798!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2Fcc%2Fed%2F0174f24b867f4b6532b1b09745b9%2F9ba952c0838c4d4c90d4fc12bc578d08 2x"> <source width="599" height="399" srcset="https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/381d41b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5400x3600+0+0/resize/599x399!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2Fcc%2Fed%2F0174f24b867f4b6532b1b09745b9%2F9ba952c0838c4d4c90d4fc12bc578d08 1x,https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/63a4bcd/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5400x3600+0+0/resize/1198x798!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2Fcc%2Fed%2F0174f24b867f4b6532b1b09745b9%2F9ba952c0838c4d4c90d4fc12bc578d08 2x"> <img alt="Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, left, talks with Board of Governors member Lisa Cook, right, during an open meeting of the Board of Governors at the Federal Reserve, June 25, 2025, in Washington.

Policymakers opted for a quarter-point cut to the central bank's benchmark rate, in line with expectations. It's now set at 4% to 4.25%.</p><p>"The labor market is really cooling off," Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at a news conference Wednesday after the announcement. </p><p>The Trump administration has mounted an unprecedented pressure campaign that has included attacks on Powell for not lowering rates sooner, as well as an effort to unseat a Biden-era Fed appointee over accusations of mortgage fraud. </p><p>But Powell and the Fed had resisted Trump's pressure, saying its dual mandate of keeping both unemployment and inflation low meant it needed to be careful not to overheat the economy and risk a return to rapidly rising prices.</p><p>"We&rsquo;ve done very large rate hikes and very large rate cuts in the last five years, and you tend to do those at a time when you feel that policy is out of place and needs to move quickly to a new place," Powell said. "That&rsquo;s not at all what I feel."</p><p>The vote for the quarter-point cut by the Fed's rate-setting committee was 11 to 1. The sole dissenter, in favor of a larger half-point cut, was<strong> </strong>newly appointed governor Stephen Miran. He was sworn in this week even as he maintains his title as chair of the White House&rsquo;s Council of Economic Advisers, though he is officially on leave from that role.</p><p>President Donald Trump's two other appointed governors, Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller, both voted for the quarter-point cut.</p><p>In its statement Wednesday, the Fed indicated it expects two more rate cuts this year. However, seven of the 12 officials on the Fed's rate-cutting committee indicated that rates should remain unchanged for the rest of the year. </p><p>The committee will meet again in October and December.<strong> </strong></p><p>The labor market appears to be slowing dramatically.<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/august-2025-jobs-report-how-many-which-industries-what-to-know-rcna228780"> August&rsquo;s jobs report showed</a> that just 22,000 jobs were added, far below economists&rsquo; expectations. That report also showed that the United States lost jobs in June. So far this year, the economy has added 598,000 jobs, compared with 1.4 million for the first eight months of 2024. The unemployment rate also ticked higher last month, to 4.3%, a level not seen since September 2017 outside of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p>At the news conference, Powell called the labor market &ldquo;unusual,&rdquo; noting that fewer firms are hiring &mdash; but that the available supply of workers is also declining because of Trump&rsquo;s immigration crackdown. </p><p>Lower rates could help businesses hire as it becomes less expensive to take out loans and credit card rates fall for consumers.</p><p>At the same time, inflation has been creeping up. Since April, when Trump announced his sweeping &ldquo;reciprocal&rdquo; tariffs,<a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CPIAUCSL#"> inflation has increased</a> from 2.3% to 2.9% in August. The Fed&rsquo;s inflation target is 2%.</p><p>Fed officials said in a separate set of economic projections that they see two additional quarter-point rate cuts this year and a third in 2026. </p><p>&ldquo;After weak July and August employment reports and<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/911000-fewer-jobs-created-april-2024-march-2025-bls-says-rcna230065"> a large negative preliminary benchmark revision</a>, job growth now appears to be much lower and below the breakeven rate, the risks still tilt toward further negative revisions, the unemployment rate has risen slightly for two months in a row, and our broader measure of labor market slack has risen a bit more,&rdquo; Goldman Sachs economists wrote.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Heading into Wednesday,<a href="https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html"> markets were pricing</a> in a high likelihood of a total of three-quarters of a percentage point in cuts by the end of the year.</p><p>In recent interviews and earnings calls, companies have also flagged slower spending by a large chunk of the population.</p><p>McDonald&rsquo;s CEO Chris Kempczinski called it a &ldquo;two-tier economy&rdquo; in a CNBC<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/09/02/mcdonaldas-ceo-middle-and-lower-income-consumers-are-under-a-lot-of-pressure-right-now.html"> interview this month.</a> While upper-income households continue to spend freely, &ldquo;middle- and lower-income consumers, they&rsquo;re feeling under a lot of pressure right now.&rdquo;</p><p>Several prominent economists aren&rsquo;t convinced a Fed cut is warranted at this point. Joseph Gagnon, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, noted last month that inflation was still lingering above the Fed&rsquo;s 2% target even before Trump&rsquo;s tariffs. &ldquo;Price pressures are likely to pick up in coming months as businesses are forced to pass on higher tariff costs to protect their profit margins,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>Stock markets are thriving, too.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not unprecedented for the Fed to ease when stocks are at or near all-time highs,&rdquo; JPMorgan Chase chief U.S. economist Michael Feroli said in early August. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s rarer when stocks are at the highs and inflation is above target and inflecting higher.&rdquo;</p><p>This Fed meeting is also the first with Miran, the newly confirmed governor, who joins the Fed under highly unusual circumstances. Members of the independent central bank historically haven&rsquo;t held other outside roles during their tenures. Miran is on unpaid leave from the economic advisers council and could return to the White House when his Fed term concludes at the end of January. The administration has sought to downplay the arrangement.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s anything irregular about it at all,&rdquo; Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Tuesday on CNBC.</p><p>&ldquo;Everyone knows that he&rsquo;s going back&rdquo; to the White House, &ldquo;so I think cards on the table it&rsquo;s actually much more transparent,&rdquo; Bessent added.</p><p>The Trump administration has sought to further increase its influence on the Fed by trying to fire Lisa Cook, the first Black woman to work on the board of governors, over allegations of mortgage fraud. Cook hasn&rsquo;t been charged with a crime. An appeals court has ruled she can&rsquo;t be removed while she sues the administration over its attempt to terminate her. For now, Cook remains in place.</p><p>It all comes after months of attacks from Trump. Seeking lower rates, he and others in his administration have hammered Powell with personal insults and have said the entire Fed board should be &ldquo;ashamed&rdquo; of its work.</p><p>But Powell has maintained that the Fed must remain cautious.</p><p>"We&rsquo;ve seen much more challenging economic times, but from a policy standpoint ... it&rsquo;s challenging to know what to do," Powell said Wednesday. "There are no risk-free paths." </p></div><div><div><p><span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/author/steve-kopack-ncpn387336">Steve Kopack</a></span></p><p>Steve Kopack is a senior reporter at NBC News covering business and the economy.</p></div><div><p><span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/author/rob-wile-ncpn1293609">Rob Wile</a></span></p><p>Rob Wile is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist covering breaking business stories for NBCNews.com.</p></div><div><p>Brian Cheung</p><p>contributed</p><p>.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="gallery"><p><img src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2024_51/3672748/steve_kopack.jpg"></p><p><img src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2022_13/3544534/xyndgjrf_400x400.jpeg"></p></div></section><section class='separator separator-before-comments'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='comments'><p>Top comments</p><ol><li><div class="md"><p>Is this likely to really have any meaningful ramifications on employment?

We are at peak margin loan debt and credit card debt in an environment with very punitive interest rates. At some point, especially for folks &lt;30, it just makes more sense to default and declare bankruptcy. If enough folks do that you end up with a financial crisis. As an anecdotal sidenote, all of my Gen Z family and co-workers seem incredibly flippant about credit in general. It seems to be a combo of ignorance and fatalism. If that mentality proves too common we could have big long term issues.</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/1njkcvq/gen_z_leads_biggest_drop_in_fico_scores_since/nerbttl/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p></li></ol></section>]]></description><pubDate>Wed, 17 Sep 2025 23:27:57 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.fastcompany.com/91405390/u-s-credit-scores-suffer-largest-two-year-drop-since-great-recession</link><title>U.S. credit scores suffers largest 2-year drop since Great Recession (fastcompany.com)</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/1nj87c9/us_credit_scores_suffers_largest_2year_drop_since/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/1nj87c9/us_credit_scores_suffers_largest_2year_drop_since/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/1nj87c9/us_credit_scores_suffers_largest_2year_drop_since/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='separator separator-before-comments'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='comments'><p>Top comments</p><ol><li><div class="md"><p>The new national average is 715, down from 718 two years ago, as household debt climbs and inflation bites.</p><p>The data also shows that compared with 2021, more Americans are falling into the low and high ends of the credit score range rather than the middle. In 2021, 38% of scores were between 600 and 749; in 2025, that percentage is 33.8%. The highest FICO score is 850.</p><p>U.S. borrowers continue to grapple with high interest rates, a side effect of the Federal Reserve’s efforts to rein in the soaring post-pandemic inflation that’s driving high prices. In spite of those efforts—and with rate cuts imminent—President Trump’s tariffs are pushing inflation up yet again, making the cost of gas, groceries, clothes, and other essentials even less affordable. </p><p>“The recent K-shaped economy has led to financial stress for some borrowers impacted by affordability concerns stemming from inflation and higher interest rates, while others have benefited from increases in their stock market portfolios and home price appreciation,” the FICO report states. That data reflects America’s wealth gap, wherein the rich get richer and the poor get poorer, hollowing out the middle class in the process.</p><p>Falling credit scores among young people are linked to resumed student loan delinquency reporting, which reappeared on credit reports in February for the first time after the CARES Act. While only 17% of the broader U.S. population is still paying down a student loan, that percentage is 34% for Gen Z. It’s no surprise then that 14% of Gen Zers had a 50-point score drop in the last year, with late student loan payments hitting their credit reports for the first time.</p><p>For people in the U.S distant from the stock market’s highs, the economy is starting to feel like America during a very different era—a malaise backed by the new data. “Delinquency rates on auto loans, credit cards, and personal loans are at or near their highest levels since 2009, during the Great Recession—and are more consistent with an economy in recession than one still in expansion,” the FICO report states.</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/1nj87c9/us_credit_scores_suffers_largest_2year_drop_since/neob80n/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><div class="md"><p>I don’t know enough about credit scoring in aggregate, but wouldn’t this be a sign that we are already underway an economic event? Scores fluctuate with 30, 60, and 90 day delinquencies and defaults, along with high balances being carried over? Doesn’t seem like it’s a good indicator of economic health.</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/1nj87c9/us_credit_scores_suffers_largest_2year_drop_since/nepp69y/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><div class="md"><p>It&#39;s down 3 points in 2 years. The range is 300-850, or 550 points. The average score is down 0.55% of the range. In other words, a 3 point change over 2 years is hardly concerning. Also, we should consider that the way credit scores are calculated isn&#39;t publicly available. These private companies have most likely tweaked their scoring systems.</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/1nj87c9/us_credit_scores_suffers_largest_2year_drop_since/nept2ud/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p></li></ol></section>]]></description><pubDate>Wed, 17 Sep 2025 14:44:55 +0530</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
