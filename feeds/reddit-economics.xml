Policymakers opted for a quarter-point cut to the central bank's benchmark rate, in line with expectations. It's now set at 4% to 4.25%.</p><p>"The labor market is really cooling off," Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at a news conference Wednesday after the announcement. </p><p>The Trump administration has mounted an unprecedented pressure campaign that has included attacks on Powell for not lowering rates sooner, as well as an effort to unseat a Biden-era Fed appointee over accusations of mortgage fraud. </p><p>But Powell and the Fed had resisted Trump's pressure, saying its dual mandate of keeping both unemployment and inflation low meant it needed to be careful not to overheat the economy and risk a return to rapidly rising prices.</p><p>"We&rsquo;ve done very large rate hikes and very large rate cuts in the last five years, and you tend to do those at a time when you feel that policy is out of place and needs to move quickly to a new place," Powell said. "That&rsquo;s not at all what I feel."</p><p>The vote for the quarter-point cut by the Fed's rate-setting committee was 11 to 1. The sole dissenter, in favor of a larger half-point cut, was<strong> </strong>newly appointed governor Stephen Miran. He was sworn in this week even as he maintains his title as chair of the White House&rsquo;s Council of Economic Advisers, though he is officially on leave from that role.</p><p>President Donald Trump's two other appointed governors, Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller, both voted for the quarter-point cut.</p><p>In its statement Wednesday, the Fed indicated it expects two more rate cuts this year. However, seven of the 12 officials on the Fed's rate-cutting committee indicated that rates should remain unchanged for the rest of the year. </p><p>The committee will meet again in October and December.<strong> </strong></p><p>The labor market appears to be slowing dramatically.<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/august-2025-jobs-report-how-many-which-industries-what-to-know-rcna228780"> August&rsquo;s jobs report showed</a> that just 22,000 jobs were added, far below economists&rsquo; expectations. That report also showed that the United States lost jobs in June. So far this year, the economy has added 598,000 jobs, compared with 1.4 million for the first eight months of 2024. The unemployment rate also ticked higher last month, to 4.3%, a level not seen since September 2017 outside of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p>At the news conference, Powell called the labor market &ldquo;unusual,&rdquo; noting that fewer firms are hiring &mdash; but that the available supply of workers is also declining because of Trump&rsquo;s immigration crackdown. </p><p>Lower rates could help businesses hire as it becomes less expensive to take out loans and credit card rates fall for consumers.</p><p>At the same time, inflation has been creeping up. Since April, when Trump announced his sweeping &ldquo;reciprocal&rdquo; tariffs,<a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CPIAUCSL#"> inflation has increased</a> from 2.3% to 2.9% in August. The Fed&rsquo;s inflation target is 2%.</p><p>Fed officials said in a separate set of economic projections that they see two additional quarter-point rate cuts this year and a third in 2026. </p><p>&ldquo;After weak July and August employment reports and<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/911000-fewer-jobs-created-april-2024-march-2025-bls-says-rcna230065"> a large negative preliminary benchmark revision</a>, job growth now appears to be much lower and below the breakeven rate, the risks still tilt toward further negative revisions, the unemployment rate has risen slightly for two months in a row, and our broader measure of labor market slack has risen a bit more,&rdquo; Goldman Sachs economists wrote.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Heading into Wednesday,<a href="https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html"> markets were pricing</a> in a high likelihood of a total of three-quarters of a percentage point in cuts by the end of the year.</p><p>In recent interviews and earnings calls, companies have also flagged slower spending by a large chunk of the population.</p><p>McDonald&rsquo;s CEO Chris Kempczinski called it a &ldquo;two-tier economy&rdquo; in a CNBC<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/09/02/mcdonaldas-ceo-middle-and-lower-income-consumers-are-under-a-lot-of-pressure-right-now.html"> interview this month.</a> While upper-income households continue to spend freely, &ldquo;middle- and lower-income consumers, they&rsquo;re feeling under a lot of pressure right now.&rdquo;</p><p>Several prominent economists aren&rsquo;t convinced a Fed cut is warranted at this point. Joseph Gagnon, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, noted last month that inflation was still lingering above the Fed&rsquo;s 2% target even before Trump&rsquo;s tariffs. &ldquo;Price pressures are likely to pick up in coming months as businesses are forced to pass on higher tariff costs to protect their profit margins,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>Stock markets are thriving, too.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not unprecedented for the Fed to ease when stocks are at or near all-time highs,&rdquo; JPMorgan Chase chief U.S. economist Michael Feroli said in early August. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s rarer when stocks are at the highs and inflation is above target and inflecting higher.&rdquo;</p><p>This Fed meeting is also the first with Miran, the newly confirmed governor, who joins the Fed under highly unusual circumstances. Members of the independent central bank historically haven&rsquo;t held other outside roles during their tenures. Miran is on unpaid leave from the economic advisers council and could return to the White House when his Fed term concludes at the end of January. The administration has sought to downplay the arrangement.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s anything irregular about it at all,&rdquo; Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Tuesday on CNBC.</p><p>&ldquo;Everyone knows that he&rsquo;s going back&rdquo; to the White House, &ldquo;so I think cards on the table it&rsquo;s actually much more transparent,&rdquo; Bessent added.</p><p>The Trump administration has sought to further increase its influence on the Fed by trying to fire Lisa Cook, the first Black woman to work on the board of governors, over allegations of mortgage fraud. Cook hasn&rsquo;t been charged with a crime. An appeals court has ruled she can&rsquo;t be removed while she sues the administration over its attempt to terminate her. For now, Cook remains in place.</p><p>It all comes after months of attacks from Trump. Seeking lower rates, he and others in his administration have hammered Powell with personal insults and have said the entire Fed board should be &ldquo;ashamed&rdquo; of its work.</p><p>But Powell has maintained that the Fed must remain cautious.</p><p>"We&rsquo;ve seen much more challenging economic times, but from a policy standpoint ... it&rsquo;s challenging to know what to do," Powell said Wednesday. "There are no risk-free paths." </p></div><div><div><p><span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/author/steve-kopack-ncpn387336">Steve Kopack</a></span></p><p>Steve Kopack is a senior reporter at NBC News covering business and the economy.</p></div><div><p><span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/author/rob-wile-ncpn1293609">Rob Wile</a></span></p><p>Rob Wile is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist covering breaking business stories for NBCNews.com.</p></div><div><p>Brian Cheung</p><p>contributed</p><p>.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="gallery"><p><img src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2024_51/3672748/steve_kopack.jpg"></p><p><img src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2022_13/3544534/xyndgjrf_400x400.jpeg"></p></div></section><section class='separator separator-before-comments'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='comments'><p>Top comments</p><ol><li><div class="md"><p>Is this likely to really have any meaningful ramifications on employment?

In 2021, 38% of scores were between 600 and 749; in 2025, that percentage is 33.8%. The highest FICO score is 850.</p><p>U.S. borrowers continue to grapple with high interest rates, a side effect of the Federal Reserve’s efforts to rein in the soaring post-pandemic inflation that’s driving high prices. In spite of those efforts—and with rate cuts imminent—President Trump’s tariffs are pushing inflation up yet again, making the cost of gas, groceries, clothes, and other essentials even less affordable. </p><p>“The recent K-shaped economy has led to financial stress for some borrowers impacted by affordability concerns stemming from inflation and higher interest rates, while others have benefited from increases in their stock market portfolios and home price appreciation,” the FICO report states. That data reflects America’s wealth gap, wherein the rich get richer and the poor get poorer, hollowing out the middle class in the process.</p><p>Falling credit scores among young people are linked to resumed student loan delinquency reporting, which reappeared on credit reports in February for the first time after the CARES Act. While only 17% of the broader U.S. population is still paying down a student loan, that percentage is 34% for Gen Z. It’s no surprise then that 14% of Gen Zers had a 50-point score drop in the last year, with late student loan payments hitting their credit reports for the first time.</p><p>For people in the U.S distant from the stock market’s highs, the economy is starting to feel like America during a very different era—a malaise backed by the new data. “Delinquency rates on auto loans, credit cards, and personal loans are at or near their highest levels since 2009, during the Great Recession—and are more consistent with an economy in recession than one still in expansion,” the FICO report states.</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/1nj87c9/us_credit_scores_suffers_largest_2year_drop_since/neob80n/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><div class="md"><p>I don’t know enough about credit scoring in aggregate, but wouldn’t this be a sign that we are already underway an economic event?

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free </em><a href="https://www.cnn.com/newsletters/what-matters?source=nl-acq_article"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em> </p><p>Republicans and President Donald Trump want credit for what he has called &ldquo;the largest tax cut in the history of our country&rdquo; for the income tax cuts in his One Big Beautiful Bill Act. </p><p>Democrats and free trade advocates have said Trump&rsquo;s tariff policy, which placed levies on most imported goods from around the world, is one of the largest <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/31/economy/tariffs-largest-tax-hike">tax hikes</a> in history. </p><p>Both claims are debatable, but for most Americans how tariffs and tax cuts will affect their daily lives is a highly relevant question. </p><p>The answers are hard to find and nuanced. But the bottom line, according to calculations by the Yale Budget Lab, is that American households could pay $2,300 more, on average, as result of the current tariff policy, nearly three times the average roughly $800 benefit from the OBBBA&rsquo;s new tax provisions. </p><p>&ldquo;For households as a whole, the total tax increase they&rsquo;ll feel from tariffs is larger than the total tax cut they&rsquo;ll feel from the new provisions in the Republican tax package,&rdquo; said John Ricco, the lab&rsquo;s associate director of policy analysis. </p><p>There are multiple variables that complicate things. </p><p>First, tariffs have not yet sparked inflation on the level that many economists have predicted &mdash; although it is <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/11/economy/us-cpi-consumer-price-index-inflation-august">ticking up</a>. There&rsquo;s evidence that some of the impact from tariffs <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/24/economy/us-tariffs-passthrough-consumers">could be delayed,</a> and much of the president&rsquo;s tariff policy has only recently <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/06/business/trump-tariffs-in-effect">kicked in</a>. Plus, the US economy is massive and decentralized and there are many factors beyond tariffs and taxes at play. </p><p>Trump and Republicans have said the tax cuts are much larger than the tariffs, an argument that sidesteps the reality that the bulk of the tax cuts may not be noticed by many Americans. Rather than enact entirely new tax cuts, much of what the bill does is make permanent individual tax cuts that were passed as temporary policy during Trump&rsquo;s first term. </p><p>Plus, specific measures like a temporary reprieve for taxes on tips will only help slivers of the workforce. The tax bill also includes cuts to the social safety net like <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/11/politics/food-stamps-work-requirements-trump-bill">food assistance</a> and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/21/politics/americans-losing-health-insurance-trump-bill">Medicaid</a>, with the expectation that millions of people will lose these benefits, affecting their quality of life and financial resources. </p><p>Even before those cuts, the cost burden of tariffs is expected to push hundreds of thousands of Americans into poverty next year, according to a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/10/business/trump-trade-prices-poverty-report">separate Yale analysis</a>. </p><p>Tariffs amount to a national sales tax on imported goods, although the rate of tariffs varies by country and continues to change. Their impact could likewise evolve if, as Trump promises, they kickstart a US manufacturing renaissance. </p><p>One detailed comparison of how tariffs and tax cuts will affect Americans comes from the Yale Budget Lab, which concluded in a recent analysis that only those highest on the income ladder will come out ahead over the next decade when tariffs are put alongside tax cuts. </p><p>The top 10% of households, those who on average are making $518,000 per year, will pay about $13,600 less in taxes, according to Yale&rsquo;s analysis. They&rsquo;ll have to spend nearly $5,450 more, on average, because of tariff-fueled price increases. </p><p>That combined effect of tariffs and tax increases will net out to an income boost of about $8,200, or 1.6%, according to Yale. </p><p>Middle-income households, who on average are making between about $105,000 to $122,000, will see their average $1,200 tax cut more than offset by a $2,200 cumulative tariff price hike, in the Yale analysis. </p><p>Those who make the least will be hurt the most. The bottom 10% will see their average annual income drop by almost $2,600, or 6.6%, the lab found. They&rsquo;ll take an average $1,350 hit to their wallets from tariffs coupled with a roughly $1,200 hit, on average, from the &ldquo;big, beautiful bill,&rdquo; largely because the Republican package slashed spending on the nation&rsquo;s safety net to pay for part of the tax breaks. These folks have an average income of just under $39,000. </p><p>Plus, while the higher cost of goods from tariffs affects every household, it will disproportionately hurt lower-income consumers because they spend a higher share of their income than the wealthy do, Ricco said. </p><p>That impact is clear from a separate report Yale issued in early September on Trump&rsquo;s tariff policies. It showed that while the wealthiest Americans will lose nearly $5,250 in disposable income in 2027 because of higher prices, that only amounts to only 1% of their income. </p><p>By contrast, tariffs will cut more than $1,300 out of the income of the bottom 10%, but that accounts for 3.5% of their disposable income, Yale found. </p><p>The real-world effect of the new tax and spending cut bill will be further muted by the fact that most of the tax cuts are extensions of tax cuts that would have expired rather than new tax cuts. </p><p>Looking only at the new measures in the package, including the temporary elimination of taxes on some tips and overtime, the enhanced deduction for senior citizens and the beefed-up child tax credit, Americans will get an $800 break on their taxes in coming years, according to Yale. If extending the expiring cuts is added in, the average tax cut rises to $3,000. </p><p>Different research groups and think tanks use different calculations to gauge tax cuts compared to tariffs, but their bottom-line assessments are the same. </p><p>&ldquo;Tax cuts are higher for higher-income people, whereas tariffs have the opposite effects; they are much more evenly distributed,&rdquo; said Joseph Rosenberg, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. That means they will hit lower income Americans harder. </p><p>While the tariffs, as currently constructed, will outweigh the tax cuts for most Americans, it&rsquo;s also important to look at how the two contrasting tax policies will affect the country&rsquo;s bottom line. </p><p>The beefed-up tariffs are projected to lower the federal deficit by $3.3 trillion over the 2025 to 2035 period and to reduce interest costs by an additional roughly $700 billion, for a total impact of $4 trillion, according to the Congressional Budget Office&rsquo;s latest estimate, which looked at tariffs imposed as of August 19. </p><p>The GOP tax and spending cuts package is expected to increase the federal debt by an estimated $4.1 trillion or so between 2025 and 2034, more than Trump&rsquo;s tariffs are forecast to bring in. It is expected to increase the deficit by $3.4 trillion and add roughly $718 billion in interest costs. </p><p>Adam Michel, director of tax policy studies at the libertarian-leaning CATO Institute, said even if the tariffs end up canceling out the impacts of the tax cuts, the effects of the two policies could make the country more unequal. </p><p>The tax cuts are &ldquo;riddled with special interest carveouts that treat similarly situated Americans with vastly different tax systems.&rdquo; Consider the increased state and local tax deductions for many East Coast homeowners, new deductions for oil and gas companies, whalers in Alaska and rum producers in Louisiana, <a href="https://www.cato.org/commentary/three-best-worst-things-trumps-big-tax-law">among others</a>. </p><p>The same is true of tariffs, he said, which will hit some industries harder than others. </p><p>&ldquo;Together, these two changes mean we are moving toward a far more unequal and unstable fiscal system that trades durable reform for lumpy, distortionary breaks and levies that undermine long-run stability and fairness,&rdquo; he said. </p></div><div class="gallery"><p><img src="https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2025-07-04t222248z-1655257089-rc2yffabmo0f-rtrmadp-3-usa-trump.jpg?c=original&amp;q=w_860,c_fill"></p></div></section><section class='separator separator-before-comments'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='comments'><p>Top comments</p><ol><li><div class="md"><p>This was literally the reason that even back in the 1910s, during the Woodrow Wilson presidency, an income tax was signed into law and supported and ratified by all the states.</p><p>Before then, Tariffs were the main source of revenue rather than income tax, and that was a Republican policy(nothing has changed).

I&#39;m trying to learn about all of this, so I can respond appropriately to preserve my purchasing power. It&#39;s my understanding that some economists have speculated that the intention of these tariffs (and other measures taken by the admin) may have been to trigger the Fed Reserve to be forced to lower interest rates. In turn, this would push inflation up, thereby allowing the federal government to pay off the debt easier over a period of time. The time for austerity cuts has long passed. Maybe we could&#39;ve attacked the debt with real growth through green initiatives but the fossil fuel industry (cough Koch Brothers) have cut that off time and time again. </p><p>So, we are left with default or &quot;financial repression&quot;.

Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins&rsquo; <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/07/08/congress/rollins-says-able-bodied-medicaid-recipients-should-replace-immigrant-farm-workforce-00442065">assurances that American workers and machines can help close the gap</a> ring hollow among farmers who have become reliant on migrant labor that is increasingly hard to find in the face of Trump&rsquo;s immigration crackdown.</p><p>The U.S. agricultural workforce fell by 155,000 &mdash; about 7 percent &mdash; between March and July, according to <span>an analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics data</span>. That tracks with <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/08/21/key-findings-about-us-immigrants/">Pew Research Center data</a> that shows total immigrant labor fell by 750,000 from January through July. The labor shortage piles onto an ongoing economic crisis for farmers exacerbated by <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/10/farmers-trump-loyalty-agriculture-trade-00554909">dwindling export markets that could leave them with crop surpluses</a>.</p><p>&ldquo;People don&rsquo;t understand that if we don&rsquo;t get more labor, our cows don&rsquo;t get milked and our crops don&rsquo;t get picked,&rdquo; said Tim Wood, a dairy farmer and a member of the Pennsylvania Farm Bureau board of directors.</p><p>Farmers often turn to undocumented laborers because of the red tape and high costs associated with the H-2A program, which allows migrant workers to fill jobs in seasonal agricultural industries. They also complain that H-2A, the nation&rsquo;s largest temporary visa program, is off-limits to employers looking to hire for year-round operations like dairy farms.</p><p>Thompson said he&rsquo;s heard those concerns loud and clear.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to be more urgent than I have been on this issue for a couple years,&rdquo; he said on Capitol Hill last week.<br></p><p>Thompson said he plans to introduce a solution based on the <a href="https://agriculture.house.gov/UploadedFiles/ALWG_Final_Report_-_3.7.23.pdf">15 bipartisan policy recommendations</a> proposed by the Agricultural Labor Working Group last year. Some of those recommendations, like restructuring the wage methodology for workers hired under the H-2A visa program, are <span>already being undertaken</span> by the Agriculture and Labor departments through rulemaking.</p><p>While he welcomes the administration&rsquo;s efforts to reform H-2A, Thompson sees them as temporary and no substitute for legislative action.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only going to last as long as this administration does, and that&rsquo;s why we have to codify this,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Because what farmers need [is] certainty.&rdquo;</p><p>Certainty has become more elusive this year in light of the Trump administration&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/16/trump-ice-raids-farm-workers-truce-00405777">back-and-forth on immigration enforcement,</a> which has sown confusion among farmers and others in the agriculture industry.</p><p>&ldquo;The absence of clear farm labor rules and policy can lead to delays in harvesting, wasted product and reduced access to nutritious food for American families,&rdquo; said John Hollay, director of government relations for the International Fresh Produce Association.</p><p>Industries that rely on H-2A workers have long criticized the program as exceedingly cumbersome and expensive, and the current environment has intensified those complaints.</p><p>A visit from Labor Department compliance inspectors that interrupted work during peak harvest season at a vegetable farm in Berwick, Pennsylvania, last month highlighted the problem.</p><p>&ldquo;It practically forces you to close business for the day,&rdquo; said Alan Kemmerer, the farmer whose produce operation was halted.</p><p>&ldquo;We moved to H-2A out of necessity,&rdquo; added Sarah Zost, an orchard grower in Gardners, Pennsylvania. &ldquo;No one wants to use the program. It&rsquo;s a paperwork nightmare.&rdquo;</p><p>Charlie Porter, the head of the Pennsylvania Farm Bureau&rsquo;s Ag Labor and Safety Committee, said farmers across his state are anxious for a solution.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a shame you have hard-working people who need labor, and a group of people who are willing to work, and they have to look over their shoulder like they&rsquo;re criminals,&rdquo; Porter said. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re not.&rdquo;<br></p><p>John Painter&rsquo;s northern Pennsylvania farm sits on land where his family has run an organic dairy for decades. A former member of the Pennsylvania Farm Bureau board of directors, Painter said he initially turned to migrant labor during Trump&rsquo;s first term, when he struggled to find willing workers.</p><p>He hired a Mexican couple who worked for him for two years until the husband was pulled over during a visit to family in New York. The man was later arrested and placed in removal proceedings after law enforcement discovered he had falsified papers. He was held in detention for more than a year before being deported to Mexico. His wife and children followed.</p><p>&ldquo;I understand that he was here illegally, but I also understand that he&rsquo;s human,&rdquo; Painter said. &ldquo;They want the American dream, and they want to work.&rdquo;</p><p>Painter eventually managed to find another couple, this one from Guatemala. But the wife is due to have a child in November, and Painter is wondering how he and the husband will manage to care for a 450-head dairy operation on their own.</p><p>&ldquo;If they&rsquo;re here working and paying their taxes,&rdquo; Painter said, &ldquo;they are not the troublemakers that we should be focusing on getting rid of.&rdquo;</p><p>Painter voted for Trump three times, but he said he&rsquo;s &ldquo;very disappointed&rdquo; in how the president has handled immigration policy this term.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not right, what they&rsquo;re doing,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;All of us, if we look back in history, including the president, we have somebody that came to this country for the American dream.&rdquo;<br></p><p>Tim Wood, a Tioga dairy farmer who also voted for Trump, said he has been unable to find a consistent workforce for several years.</p><p>He was urged to reduce stress after being treated for a heart condition in late 2024 and provided a telling response when asked by a doctor about his &ldquo;biggest stressor.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If I&rsquo;m going to have workers tomorrow,&rdquo; Wood answered. </p><p>He sold off 100 head of dairy cattle shortly after being released from the hospital.</p><p>Both Painter and Wood view Thompson as a friend and ally, but neither of them has high hopes that he can deliver a quick fix.</p><p>&ldquo;I think in G.T.&rsquo;s heart, he would like to fix it, and I think there&rsquo;s a lot of people in Congress that would like to fix it,&rdquo; Painter said. &ldquo;But the big reason why nobody fixes it is because it&rsquo;s a big political bombshell, and both parties can use it against the other one.&rdquo;</p><p>Thompson&rsquo;s proposed makeover of the H-2A program would require buy-in from Republican leaders in Congress who have shown little interest in taking up legislation that could be politically explosive.</p><p>Any proposal to overhaul the H-2A program <span>would likely face criticism</span> on the left, where many labor rights activists view it as exploitative and predatory, and on the right, where immigration hardliners say it conflicts with Trump&rsquo;s emphasis on a &ldquo;100 percent American&rdquo; workforce.</p><p>Still, agriculture advocates see this as the moment for a potential reform.</p><p>&ldquo;This is the moment of the great reveal: folks are now appreciating there are folks here in agriculture adding a whole lot of value to this food system in our communities who are not recognized,&rdquo; Pennsylvania Agriculture Secretary Russell Redding said during a panel discussion at a Penn State Ag Progress Days event last month.</p><p>Redding urged farmers to &ldquo;talk about the value that [migrant workers] have, because nobody else will.&rdquo;<br></p></div></section><section class='separator separator-before-comments'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='comments'><p>Top comments</p><ol><li><div class="md"><p>may you have the day you voted for</p><p>im already tired of these stories as they serve no purpose - these same cult members will vote red until their farms blow away ala dustbowl great depression</p><p>so many economists warned everyone over and over that trumps deport anyone tanner than coffee with cream was going to cause inflation and hardships along with mercurial tariffs that inject so much uncertainty </p><p>i have been wrong so many times about swing voters coming to their senses that hope is at a real low point, i would have bet a thousand dollars that Roe being repealed was going to cost the gop dearly and they won all 3 branches</p><p>we are going to have front row seats to the quick decline of the USA, thank you maga and lazy non-voters</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/1nhpw1w/farmers_in_deepred_pennsylvania_struggle_to_find/neda1ia/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><div class="md"><p>“The whole thing is screwed up,” said John Painter, a three-time Trump voter who runs an organic dairy farm in Westfield. “We need people to do the jobs Americans are too spoiled to do.”</p><p>If you deport all the cheap, undocumented labor in the US you will inevitably have to raise wages and benefits and follow federal labor laws to attract US citizens to work for you.
