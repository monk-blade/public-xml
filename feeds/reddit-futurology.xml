All high energy laser weapons like this are limited by thermal blooming. Basically, the laser heats the air it travels through rapidly and causes a lensing effect which defocuses the beam. This limits your range due to loss of power density at the target. This effect is inescapable even with adaptive optics, pulse lasers, and higher power (which actually makes things worse at some point). Not to mention atmospheric scattering, absorption, wind, etc. And what if the drones have reflective housings?

I don’t mean it’ll go from being the dominant world power to irrelevance in a heart beat - Rome or the British empire took from decades to centuries to lose their power - but it’s definitely in hasty decline: The economy is bad with a majority of lower and middle class Americans living paycheck to paycheck if they even have a job. Birth rates and life expectancy are going down. Democrats and Republicans live in vastly different realities where both of them see the other side as traitors who are destroying the country and the government is doing everything in their power to further the divide. President Trump’s agressive policies in both trade and diplomacy have lead to USA having no real friends left in the world and barely any allies. And so on.</p><p>Sure, USA has been through crises before but I think the current one is different and worse than the others. For instance, the 2008 economic crash was certainly bad but it didn’t lead to USA being isolated. The rest of the world still wanted to visit USA, trade with them and diplomatic relations went on as before. Now the number of tourists visiting USA is plummeting. Most strong world economies are setting up new trade routes/relations working around USA instead of with them, because no one can be sure that president Trump won’t slap a 50% tariff on them tomorrow and tank their exports to USA. And while world leaders still feel the need to humor or even flatter president Trump, none of them are dumb enough to trust a president who has build his career on not paying his debts and who could rip up any written agreement tomorrow.</p><p>USA is still the world’s strongest military power but the war in Ukraine is showing the world that modern warfare is changing drastically. That army of tanks which crushed the Iraqi army just a few decades ago would now be crushed itself by a swarm of cheap drones. Land warfare today is no longer about expensive and highly sophisticated weapons but about multitudes of cheap and simple drones. USA can still turn other countries into rubble with their missiles and air planes but any new attempts at occupying a foreign country would quickly turn into a nightmare.</p><p>So, if USA is losing their dominant position on the world stage, who will take their place? Not Europe; too divided. Russia has ruined itself in Ukraine and will need a long time to rebuild itself both economically and militarily. India’s economy is growing and their fertility rate is right around replacement level but I still think it’s at least two decades into the future for them to be a real world power. The only real contender in my opinion for taking the US spot in the near future is China. They have both the second strongest economy and the second strongest military. But their military has no experience with fighting a modern war and their economy has lots of problems: The property market has slowed to a crawl, high local government debt is causing a banking crisis and of course their trading relationship with USA (still a major trading partner) is very complicated. And their fertility rate is low, coupled with low immigration rates.</p><p>Honestly, once USA has lost their dominant position through continued political ineptitude or maybe even internal war, I don’t think any other one country or block will be able to assert their will globally the way USA has for the last 80 years. I think it more likely that we’ll see a bundle of major/regional powers doing their best to hold each other in check, but whether that’ll lead to a wary peace or open war, I’m not sure.</p><p>What do you think?</p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section><section class='separator separator-before-comments'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='comments'><p>Top comments</p><ol><li><div class="md"><blockquote><p> I think it more likely that we’ll see a bundle of major/regional powers doing their best to hold each other in check</p></blockquote><p>I think the closest analogy would be a post-Napoleonic world in the 19th century. You have several great powers (Austria, Russia, Prussia, England, France), but none of them is powerful enough to dominate the others, leading to a century of shifting coalitions and alliances.</p><p>In the same wake, you will have the US, the EU, China, India, the Middle East, Russia, and so on as great powers that still wouldn&#39;t be able to control the world on their own, leading to some alliances and coalitions. What those will be is impossible to tell, as we can all see in this year :)</p><p>That will also mean that in the period of turmoil, before a new world order is established (the current one is completely failing, as we can see with the UN and international courts), there will be a lot of wars and conflicts that were &quot;frozen&quot; while the US had the role of the world&#39;s police.</p><blockquote><p>The only real contender in my opinion for taking the US spot in the near future is China</p></blockquote><p>That is very unlikely because China is very China-centric. They can project their economic might, but the Chinese project with the Great Firewall and all the other stuff is unique to China, and they are not even trying to export it anywhere else.</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1nk5fae/what_do_you_think_a_postusa_world_order_will_look/nevc3vg/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><div class="md"><p>Rather than a straight decline or a Chinese “takeover,” the likelier path is a multipolar world where America is still first among equals.

In an effort to cut down on this waste, researchers have figured out a way to send electric pulses through the mud to purify it and allow it to be reused instead of discarded.</p><p>The aluminum-creation process begins with bauxite ore, a raw material that contains desirable aluminum-rich minerals but also a host of impurities including silica and iron and titanium oxides. To get to the aluminum, crushed bauxite is mixed with a hot and concentrated sodium hydroxide solution. This allows the aluminum minerals to dissolve while other impurities remain solid.</p><p>After the solution settles or is filtered, the aluminum minerals are harvested, forming a material known as alumina, and the rest of the materials form a solid waste known as red mud. This waste product is highly toxic because of its high alkalinity and heavy metal concentration. It is estimated that for every ton of alumina produced, one to two tons of red mud is created.</p><p>Seeking a way to reuse this waste stream, researchers from Rice University turned to a process known as flash Joule heating, in which they zapped red mud with a short high-powered electrical pulse, akin to a flash of lightning. This vaporized the harmful metals in the red mud, and left behind a purified compound rich in aluminum. They found that adding a small amount of chlorine gas to the chamber containing the red mud improved the process.</p><p>“The speed and simplicity of this method set it apart,” said Qiming Liu, co-first author of the study. “In just 60 seconds, we extracted 96% of the iron and nearly all the toxic species, while retaining almost all the aluminum.”</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1nje9wo/lightinglike_pulses_turn_toxic_red_mud_into/nepiny6/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><div class="md"><p>Only people named Frankenstein with a doctorate can do these kind of experiments.</p><p>Someone please tell me that this is actually freezable?
