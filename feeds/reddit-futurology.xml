I work for a tech company you know and use. We had an emergency meeting today even though it’s Saturday about the H-1B potentially ending. The legal folks said that it’s gonna get challenged in court so it’ll be a while and might not happen. But some of us in Silicon Valley and the tech/AI space are nervous.</p><p>On one hand some people in the meeting said well, for the employees that we really need to be in the US in person, like top developers and engineers, we can just pay the $100K for each of them, they already make $300K+, we’ll just have to factor the additional cost into the budget next year. And then we can send the rest back to India and they can work remotely.</p><p>But on the other hand, there’s a longer-term anxiety that it will be harder to attract top talent because of this policy and others, plus generally changing attitudes in the US that deter immigrants. So Shenzhen, Dubai, Singapore, etc., which are already on the upswing when it comes to global tech hubs, could overtake Silicon Valley and the US in the future.</p><p>As an American who has worked in tech for 30 years and worked with so many H1-Bs and also 20-ish% of my team is on them, I just don’t get why we’re doing this to ourselves. This has been a secret competitive advantage for us in attracting global talent and driving innovation for decades.

I don’t mean it’ll go from being the dominant world power to irrelevance in a heart beat - Rome or the British empire took from decades to centuries to lose their power - but it’s definitely in hasty decline: The economy is bad with a majority of lower and middle class Americans living paycheck to paycheck if they even have a job. Birth rates and life expectancy are going down. Democrats and Republicans live in vastly different realities where both of them see the other side as traitors who are destroying the country and the government is doing everything in their power to further the divide. President Trump’s agressive policies in both trade and diplomacy have lead to USA having no real friends left in the world and barely any allies. And so on.</p><p>Sure, USA has been through crises before but I think the current one is different and worse than the others. For instance, the 2008 economic crash was certainly bad but it didn’t lead to USA being isolated. The rest of the world still wanted to visit USA, trade with them and diplomatic relations went on as before. Now the number of tourists visiting USA is plummeting. Most strong world economies are setting up new trade routes/relations working around USA instead of with them, because no one can be sure that president Trump won’t slap a 50% tariff on them tomorrow and tank their exports to USA. And while world leaders still feel the need to humor or even flatter president Trump, none of them are dumb enough to trust a president who has build his career on not paying his debts and who could rip up any written agreement tomorrow.</p><p>USA is still the world’s strongest military power but the war in Ukraine is showing the world that modern warfare is changing drastically. That army of tanks which crushed the Iraqi army just a few decades ago would now be crushed itself by a swarm of cheap drones. Land warfare today is no longer about expensive and highly sophisticated weapons but about multitudes of cheap and simple drones. USA can still turn other countries into rubble with their missiles and air planes but any new attempts at occupying a foreign country would quickly turn into a nightmare.</p><p>So, if USA is losing their dominant position on the world stage, who will take their place? Not Europe; too divided. Russia has ruined itself in Ukraine and will need a long time to rebuild itself both economically and militarily. India’s economy is growing and their fertility rate is right around replacement level but I still think it’s at least two decades into the future for them to be a real world power. The only real contender in my opinion for taking the US spot in the near future is China. They have both the second strongest economy and the second strongest military. But their military has no experience with fighting a modern war and their economy has lots of problems: The property market has slowed to a crawl, high local government debt is causing a banking crisis and of course their trading relationship with USA (still a major trading partner) is very complicated.

You have several great powers (Austria, Russia, Prussia, England, France), but none of them is powerful enough to dominate the others, leading to a century of shifting coalitions and alliances.</p><p>In the same wake, you will have the US, the EU, China, India, the Middle East, Russia, and so on as great powers that still wouldn&#39;t be able to control the world on their own, leading to some alliances and coalitions. What those will be is impossible to tell, as we can all see in this year :)</p><p>That will also mean that in the period of turmoil, before a new world order is established (the current one is completely failing, as we can see with the UN and international courts), there will be a lot of wars and conflicts that were &quot;frozen&quot; while the US had the role of the world&#39;s police.</p><blockquote><p>The only real contender in my opinion for taking the US spot in the near future is China</p></blockquote><p>That is very unlikely because China is very China-centric. They can project their economic might, but the Chinese project with the Great Firewall and all the other stuff is unique to China, and they are not even trying to export it anywhere else.</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1nk5fae/what_do_you_think_a_postusa_world_order_will_look/nevc3vg/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><div class="md"><p>Rather than a straight decline or a Chinese “takeover,” the likelier path is a multipolar world where America is still first among equals.

Now the number of tourists visiting USA is plummeting. Most strong world economies are setting up new trade routes/relations working around USA instead of with them, because no one can be sure that president Trump won’t slap a 50% tariff on them tomorrow and tank their exports to USA</p></blockquote><p>Keep in mind that&#39;s the world importing stuff to us. That&#39;s not going to go away. It&#39;s also not isolating us</p><blockquote><p>USA is still the world’s strongest military power but the war in Ukraine is showing the world that modern warfare is changing drastically. That army of tanks which crushed the Iraqi army just a few decades ago would now be crushed itself by a swarm of cheap drones. Land warfare today is no longer about expensive and highly sophisticated weapons but about multitudes of cheap and simple drones. USA can still turn other countries into rubble with their missiles and air planes but any new attempts at occupying a foreign country would quickly turn into a nightmare.</p></blockquote><p>No offense, but you didn&#39;t serve, did you? I ask this because you&#39;re speaking from a myopic point of view. I can&#39;t fault you for it, because it&#39;s the point of view the media is presenting, and they&#39;re the myopic ones.</p><p>Simply put: Ukraine, a 3rd rate military is holding off Russia, a 2nd rate military, with a few 1st rate military toys. Toys that are intended to work in concert with other toys <em>not</em> given to Ukraine, and Ukraine is <em>still</em> holding Russia off. It&#39;s like using a Phalanx (the fighting tactic) with every third man missing. The US&#39;s mastery of JADO would render most of the Russian military useless in minutes.</p><p>Hell, if a squadron of Growlers were sent to Ukraine, the war would be over next week.</p><blockquote><p>The only real contender in my opinion for taking the US spot in the near future is China</p></blockquote><p>They don&#39;t even have a true blue water navy.</p><blockquote><p>They have both the second strongest economy and the second strongest military.</p></blockquote><p>No they don&#39;t.

The world was in shambles. Only industrial economies left were the US and Russia. Russia absorbed territory. The US provided overwatch while the rest of the world rebuilt itself. We guarded trade rates <em>so</em> the rest of the world could rebuild itself. Then it got used to that. Stop pretending that we were some sort of usurper. The world asked for our protection, then came to demand it. The Soviet Union never gave up territory and forced the populace under their brutal oppression.</p><p>Overall the media is giving you an absurdly naive interpretation of the world.</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1nk5fae/what_do_you_think_a_postusa_world_order_will_look/newife9/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p></li></ol></section>]]></description><pubDate>Thu, 18 Sep 2025 16:44:19 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-indias-power-sector-co2-falls-for-only-second-time-in-half-a-century/</link><title>Analysis: India's power-sector CO2 emissions begin to decline as renewable energy surges (carbonbrief.org)</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1njzwo9/analysis_indias_powersector_co2_emissions_begin/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1njzwo9/analysis_indias_powersector_co2_emissions_begin/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1njzwo9/analysis_indias_powersector_co2_emissions_begin/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='separator separator-before-comments'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='comments'><p>Top comments</p><ol><li><div class="md"><p>must be all those EVs on the road.
