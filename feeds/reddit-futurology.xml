All high energy laser weapons like this are limited by thermal blooming. Basically, the laser heats the air it travels through rapidly and causes a lensing effect which defocuses the beam. This limits your range due to loss of power density at the target. This effect is inescapable even with adaptive optics, pulse lasers, and higher power (which actually makes things worse at some point). Not to mention atmospheric scattering, absorption, wind, etc. And what if the drones have reflective housings?

I don’t mean it’ll go from being the dominant world power to irrelevance in a heart beat - Rome or the British empire took from decades to centuries to lose their power - but it’s definitely in hasty decline: The economy is bad with a majority of lower and middle class Americans living paycheck to paycheck if they even have a job. Birth rates and life expectancy are going down. Democrats and Republicans live in vastly different realities where both of them see the other side as traitors who are destroying the country and the government is doing everything in their power to further the divide. President Trump’s agressive policies in both trade and diplomacy have lead to USA having no real friends left in the world and barely any allies. And so on.</p><p>Sure, USA has been through crises before but I think the current one is different and worse than the others. For instance, the 2008 economic crash was certainly bad but it didn’t lead to USA being isolated. The rest of the world still wanted to visit USA, trade with them and diplomatic relations went on as before. Now the number of tourists visiting USA is plummeting. Most strong world economies are setting up new trade routes/relations working around USA instead of with them, because no one can be sure that president Trump won’t slap a 50% tariff on them tomorrow and tank their exports to USA. And while world leaders still feel the need to humor or even flatter president Trump, none of them are dumb enough to trust a president who has build his career on not paying his debts and who could rip up any written agreement tomorrow.</p><p>USA is still the world’s strongest military power but the war in Ukraine is showing the world that modern warfare is changing drastically. That army of tanks which crushed the Iraqi army just a few decades ago would now be crushed itself by a swarm of cheap drones. Land warfare today is no longer about expensive and highly sophisticated weapons but about multitudes of cheap and simple drones. USA can still turn other countries into rubble with their missiles and air planes but any new attempts at occupying a foreign country would quickly turn into a nightmare.</p><p>So, if USA is losing their dominant position on the world stage, who will take their place? Not Europe; too divided. Russia has ruined itself in Ukraine and will need a long time to rebuild itself both economically and militarily. India’s economy is growing and their fertility rate is right around replacement level but I still think it’s at least two decades into the future for them to be a real world power. The only real contender in my opinion for taking the US spot in the near future is China. They have both the second strongest economy and the second strongest military. But their military has no experience with fighting a modern war and their economy has lots of problems: The property market has slowed to a crawl, high local government debt is causing a banking crisis and of course their trading relationship with USA (still a major trading partner) is very complicated. And their fertility rate is low, coupled with low immigration rates.</p><p>Honestly, once USA has lost their dominant position through continued political ineptitude or maybe even internal war, I don’t think any other one country or block will be able to assert their will globally the way USA has for the last 80 years. I think it more likely that we’ll see a bundle of major/regional powers doing their best to hold each other in check, but whether that’ll lead to a wary peace or open war, I’m not sure.</p><p>What do you think?</p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section><section class='separator separator-before-comments'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='comments'><p>Top comments</p><ol><li><div class="md"><blockquote><p> I think it more likely that we’ll see a bundle of major/regional powers doing their best to hold each other in check</p></blockquote><p>I think the closest analogy would be a post-Napoleonic world in the 19th century. You have several great powers (Austria, Russia, Prussia, England, France), but none of them is powerful enough to dominate the others, leading to a century of shifting coalitions and alliances.</p><p>In the same wake, you will have the US, the EU, China, India, the Middle East, Russia, and so on as great powers that still wouldn&#39;t be able to control the world on their own, leading to some alliances and coalitions. What those will be is impossible to tell, as we can all see in this year :)</p><p>That will also mean that in the period of turmoil, before a new world order is established (the current one is completely failing, as we can see with the UN and international courts), there will be a lot of wars and conflicts that were &quot;frozen&quot; while the US had the role of the world&#39;s police.</p><blockquote><p>The only real contender in my opinion for taking the US spot in the near future is China</p></blockquote><p>That is very unlikely because China is very China-centric. They can project their economic might, but the Chinese project with the Great Firewall and all the other stuff is unique to China, and they are not even trying to export it anywhere else.</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1nk5fae/what_do_you_think_a_postusa_world_order_will_look/nevc3vg/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><div class="md"><p>Rather than a straight decline or a Chinese “takeover,” the likelier path is a multipolar world where America is still first among equals.

Toys that are intended to work in concert with other toys <em>not</em> given to Ukraine, and Ukraine is <em>still</em> holding Russia off. It&#39;s like using a Phalanx (the fighting tactic) with every third man missing. The US&#39;s mastery of JADO would render most of the Russian military useless in minutes.</p><p>Hell, if a squadron of Growlers were sent to Ukraine, the war would be over next week.</p><blockquote><p>The only real contender in my opinion for taking the US spot in the near future is China</p></blockquote><p>They don&#39;t even have a true blue water navy.</p><blockquote><p>They have both the second strongest economy and the second strongest military.</p></blockquote><p>No they don&#39;t.

The world was in shambles. Only industrial economies left were the US and Russia. Russia absorbed territory. The US provided overwatch while the rest of the world rebuilt itself. We guarded trade rates <em>so</em> the rest of the world could rebuild itself. Then it got used to that. Stop pretending that we were some sort of usurper. The world asked for our protection, then came to demand it. The Soviet Union never gave up territory and forced the populace under their brutal oppression.</p><p>Overall the media is giving you an absurdly naive interpretation of the world.</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1nk5fae/what_do_you_think_a_postusa_world_order_will_look/newife9/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p></li></ol></section>]]></description><pubDate>Thu, 18 Sep 2025 16:44:19 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.psypost.org/u-s-sees-5-7-million-more-childless-women-than-expected-fueling-a-demographic-cliff/</link><title>U.S. sees 5.7 million more childless women than expected, fueling a "demographic cliff" | This profound change in childbearing patterns has contributed to a cumulative total of 11.8 million fewer births over the past 17 years than would have occurred if earlier fertility rates had been maintained.
