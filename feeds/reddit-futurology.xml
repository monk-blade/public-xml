However, these small assemblies of brain tissue grown from stem cells are too simple to function like a real human brain. As such, scientists have assumed brain organoids lack consciousness, which has led to lax research regulations.</p><p>"We feel that in the fear of hype and science-fiction inspired exaggeration, the pendulum has swung far too far in the opposite direction," <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5517-9496"><u>Christopher Wood</u></a>, a bioethics researcher at Zhejiang University in <a href="https://www.livescience.com/tag/china">China</a>, told Live Science in an email.

But when they're grown in a solid gel or a spinning bioreactor that keeps the cells aloft, they <a href="https://www.livescience.com/health/neuroscience/we-can-t-answer-these-questions-neuroscientist-kenneth-kosik-on-whether-lab-grown-brains-will-achieve-consciousness"><u>adopt 3D anatomical networks</u></a> that resemble what's seen in an embryonic brain.</p><p>Although they develop 3D features, brain organoids are too simple to be conscious, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;xcust=livescience_us_6301690965666416501&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1007%2Fs12152-024-09548-3&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fneuroscience%2Ftiny-brains-grown-in-the-lab-could-become-conscious-and-feel-pain-and-were-not-ready"><u>some neuroscientists argue</u></a>. Consciousness in a real brain arises when <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405471221000776"><u>different regions of the organ communicate</u></a>, but organoids resemble only a single part of the brain. And none of these lab-grown minibrains are <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6503989/"><u>larger than 0.16 inches</u></a> (4 millimeters) in diameter, suggesting important faculties for consciousness are missing.</p><p>People often think of consciousness in humans or animals as a state of being aware of oneself. However, "we think of consciousness in organoids as a basic level of sensations, the capacity to feel pain and pleasure," said <a href="https://case.unipegaso.it/people/andrea-lavazza-2/"><u>Andrea Lavazza</u></a>, a moral philosopher and neuroethicist at Pegaso University in Italy.</p><p>Most neuroscientists define consciousness as self-awareness or the ability to feel or experience something, <a href="https://pediatrics.ucsd.edu/research/faculty-labs/muotri-lab/index.html"><u>Alysson Muotri</u></a>, a neuroscientist at the University of California, San Diego, told Live Science in an email. But there is no universal, agreed-upon definition, he said.</p><p>Some definitions of consciousness focus on the brain's ability to process and respond to its environment through senses, like sight and hearing. Brain organoids are cultured outside a body and cannot receive such signals, Lavazza noted. But in the future, more advanced organoids could still theoretically experience pain. In humans, membranes that envelop the brain, called meninges, contain neurons that can send pain signals to the organ. The worry is the same could be possible in more sophisticated organoids.</p><p>On the flip side, Boyd argued that "if an organoid has the internal neural architecture necessary for representing pain, then no external signal would be required." So, there need not be a pain signal from a neuron for pain to occur; this is how phantom pains arise in people who have lost limbs.</p><p>Wood noted, however, that it is unclear whether an organoid could experience something tantamount to phantom pain, as this might depend on having a memory of the lost limb. So in a word, it's complicated.</p><h2>How do you measure consciousness?</h2><p>The perspective piece pointed out that, even in humans, scientists don't have great methods of objectively measuring consciousness. Lavazza said the only way to definitively detect consciousness is to ask a person what they are feeling. That doesn't mean that people who can't communicate lack consciousness, but definitively measuring it is more difficult.</p><p>In comatose patients or people with locked-in syndrome &mdash; a neurological condition that paralyzes the body and makes communication extremely challenging &mdash; doctors rely on indirect signals, such as electrical brain activity, Lomax said. Via this activity, they can only infer consciousness, not produce a definitive measurement.</p><figure><figcaption><span>An array of microscope image of chimeroids, a type of brain organoid <a href="https://www.livescience.com/health/neuroscience/scientists-just-grew-the-1st-ever-minibrains-from-multiple-peoples-cells">grown with stem cells from multiple people</a>. </span><span>(Image credit: Noelia Ant&oacute;n-Bola&ntilde;os and Irene Faravelli)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Another measure involves "<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1935861X19302207"><u>perturbational complexity</u></a>," which assesses the complexity of brain signals produced in response to a stimulus, such as a <a href="https://www.livescience.com/tag/earths-magnetic-field">magnetic field</a> being applied to the scalp. Doctors judge that the more complex the patterns of neuronal firing, the more likely the patient is conscious, Lomax said.</p><p>But some indirect signals of consciousness, including perturbational complexity, can be seen even in neurons grown in a dish, he emphasized. That suggests they are not good indicators of the phenomenon.</p><h2>Complexity begets consciousness</h2><p>Skeptics who don't believe brain organoids could feasibly gain consciousness argue that they lack the anatomical complexity required, including a wide variety of cell types and blood vessels to deliver the oxygen and resources needed for complex signaling.</p><p>But in the next five to 10 years, technological innovations could enable scientists to create complex organoids capable of consciousness, Wood said. A <a href="https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/advs.202507256"><u>study published in August</u></a> reported a method for introducing blood vessels into brain organoids, and one from <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.adp7047"><u>September</u></a> found ways to incorporate an additional cell type, called microglia, that can't be produced from neural stem cells. Previously, scientists grew brain organoids <a href="https://www.livescience.com/brain-organoid-optic-eyes.html"><u>with rudimentary "eyes</u></a>," and another group grew <a href="https://www.livescience.com/health/neuroscience/in-a-1st-scientist-grow-mini-brains-with-functional-blood-brain-barriers"><u>some with blood-brain barriers</u></a>, which help guard the organ from toxins and pathogens.</p><p>Although current organoids resemble only one brain region, neuroscientists can fuse them to make "<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;xcust=livescience_us_1270967873863994226&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41586-025-08808-3&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fneuroscience%2Ftiny-brains-grown-in-the-lab-could-become-conscious-and-feel-pain-and-were-not-ready"><u>assembloids</u></a>" representing multiple regions.

Its guidelines say, "At this time, there is no biological evidence to suggest any issues of concern, such as consciousness or pain perception with organoids corresponding to CNS [central nervous system] tissues, that would warrant review through the specialized oversight process."</p><p>However, the experts Live Science spoke to agreed that the regulations should be reviewed following recent breakthroughs in organoid development.</p><p>"That was such a conservative vision of the ISSCR, and it needs to be revised by a multidisciplinary team, not only stem cell biologists," said Muotri, who is the founder of <a href="https://tismoo.com.br/en/about/"><u>Tismoo</u></a>, a company that develops brain organoids.</p><p>The ethical concerns partly relate to organoids potentially being able to feel pain and to form their own thoughts. "The welfare of the conscious organoid, once it is produced, needs to be taken into account, as it has become a morally relevant entity with interests," Wood explained.</p><p>Lavazza takes a different stance. "I personally do not think it would be unethical to grow brain organoids with consciousness," he said, adding that "scientists do experiments with other conscious entities, such as mice." Lomax argued that if brain organoids achieve consciousness, they should receive similar regulatory oversight as animals do in research.</p><p>Although lab-grown brains might seem like something out of "Brave New World," they may become a reality soon. Assessing consciousness and agreeing on regulations will be tricky, but Wood argued that the burden of proof should lie with the skeptic who aims to disprove consciousness rather than with the advocate who aims to show it could be feasible.</p><p>At the very least, his article pointed out, scientists shouldn't rule out the possibility.</p><hr><h2><a href="https://www.livescience.com/health/neuroscience/brain-quiz-test-your-knowledge-of-the-most-complex-organ-in-the-body">Brain quiz</a>: Test your knowledge of the most complex organ in the body</h2> </div><div><p>Kamal Nahas is a freelance contributor based in Oxford, U.K. His work has appeared in New Scientist, Science and The Scientist, among other outlets, and he mainly covers research on evolution, health and technology.

I don’t mean it’ll go from being the dominant world power to irrelevance in a heart beat - Rome or the British empire took from decades to centuries to lose their power - but it’s definitely in hasty decline: The economy is bad with a majority of lower and middle class Americans living paycheck to paycheck if they even have a job. Birth rates and life expectancy are going down. Democrats and Republicans live in vastly different realities where both of them see the other side as traitors who are destroying the country and the government is doing everything in their power to further the divide. President Trump’s agressive policies in both trade and diplomacy have lead to USA having no real friends left in the world and barely any allies. And so on.</p><p>Sure, USA has been through crises before but I think the current one is different and worse than the others. For instance, the 2008 economic crash was certainly bad but it didn’t lead to USA being isolated. The rest of the world still wanted to visit USA, trade with them and diplomatic relations went on as before. Now the number of tourists visiting USA is plummeting. Most strong world economies are setting up new trade routes/relations working around USA instead of with them, because no one can be sure that president Trump won’t slap a 50% tariff on them tomorrow and tank their exports to USA. And while world leaders still feel the need to humor or even flatter president Trump, none of them are dumb enough to trust a president who has build his career on not paying his debts and who could rip up any written agreement tomorrow.</p><p>USA is still the world’s strongest military power but the war in Ukraine is showing the world that modern warfare is changing drastically. That army of tanks which crushed the Iraqi army just a few decades ago would now be crushed itself by a swarm of cheap drones. Land warfare today is no longer about expensive and highly sophisticated weapons but about multitudes of cheap and simple drones. USA can still turn other countries into rubble with their missiles and air planes but any new attempts at occupying a foreign country would quickly turn into a nightmare.</p><p>So, if USA is losing their dominant position on the world stage, who will take their place? Not Europe; too divided. Russia has ruined itself in Ukraine and will need a long time to rebuild itself both economically and militarily. India’s economy is growing and their fertility rate is right around replacement level but I still think it’s at least two decades into the future for them to be a real world power. The only real contender in my opinion for taking the US spot in the near future is China. They have both the second strongest economy and the second strongest military. But their military has no experience with fighting a modern war and their economy has lots of problems: The property market has slowed to a crawl, high local government debt is causing a banking crisis and of course their trading relationship with USA (still a major trading partner) is very complicated. And their fertility rate is low, coupled with low immigration rates.</p><p>Honestly, once USA has lost their dominant position through continued political ineptitude or maybe even internal war, I don’t think any other one country or block will be able to assert their will globally the way USA has for the last 80 years. I think it more likely that we’ll see a bundle of major/regional powers doing their best to hold each other in check, but whether that’ll lead to a wary peace or open war, I’m not sure.</p><p>What do you think?</p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section><section class='separator separator-before-comments'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='comments'><p>Top comments</p><ol><li><div class="md"><blockquote><p> I think it more likely that we’ll see a bundle of major/regional powers doing their best to hold each other in check</p></blockquote><p>I think the closest analogy would be a post-Napoleonic world in the 19th century. You have several great powers (Austria, Russia, Prussia, England, France), but none of them is powerful enough to dominate the others, leading to a century of shifting coalitions and alliances.</p><p>In the same wake, you will have the US, the EU, China, India, the Middle East, Russia, and so on as great powers that still wouldn&#39;t be able to control the world on their own, leading to some alliances and coalitions. What those will be is impossible to tell, as we can all see in this year :)</p><p>That will also mean that in the period of turmoil, before a new world order is established (the current one is completely failing, as we can see with the UN and international courts), there will be a lot of wars and conflicts that were &quot;frozen&quot; while the US had the role of the world&#39;s police.</p><blockquote><p>The only real contender in my opinion for taking the US spot in the near future is China</p></blockquote><p>That is very unlikely because China is very China-centric.

The analysis shows that in 2024, there were 5.7 million more childless women in their primary childbearing years than anticipated, a gap that has widened substantially in recent years. This profound change in childbearing patterns has contributed to a cumulative total of 11.8 million fewer births over the past 17 years than would have occurred if earlier fertility rates had been maintained.</p><p>The rationale for this investigation stems from a long-standing question among demographers and sociologists about the lasting effects of major societal disruptions on personal life decisions, specifically the choice to have children. The period beginning with the Great Recession in 2007 initiated an era of significant economic, social, and later, public health turbulence, which was intensified by the global pandemic.</p><p>Initially, many experts believed that the decline in births seen during these periods was a temporary delay, and that many people who postponed starting a family would eventually &ldquo;catch up&rdquo; once conditions improved. However, nearly two decades after this period of instability began, fertility rates in the United States have not rebounded to previous levels. Instead, they remain near historic lows, prompting researchers to explore whether these changes represent a temporary pause or a more permanent societal realignment regarding family and childbearing.</p><p>This study sought to quantify the extent of this shift and understand the complex web of factors contributing to it. Beyond major economic and health crises, the researchers acknowledge a landscape of evolving social norms and practical realities. These include expanded educational and career opportunities for women, which can alter timelines for starting a family.</p><p>At the same time, practical considerations like the soaring costs of housing, the substantial expense of raising children, and limited access to affordable child care and paid family leave present significant hurdles. Changing patterns in relationships, such as declining marriage rates and shifts in cohabitation, also play a part. While fertility rates have always been lower among unmarried women, the research aimed to see if childlessness was also increasing among married women, suggesting a broader cultural change in attitudes about having children.</p><p>To conduct the analysis, Kenneth Johnson, a professor of sociology and senior demographer at the University of New Hampshire&rsquo;s Carsey School of Public Policy, examined a robust set of national data. He utilized information from the U.S. Census Bureau&rsquo;s Current Population Survey, analyzing annual data from 2006 through 2024. This survey provides a detailed snapshot of the American population.</p><p>This information was supplemented with comprehensive birth and fertility data from the National Center for Health Statistics. By comparing fertility patterns from before the Great Recession to the years that followed, Johnson was able to calculate the &ldquo;expected&rdquo; number of women with children versus the actual numbers observed, revealing the size of the growing gap.</p><p>In 2024, the United States was home to 44.2 million women in the prime childbearing age range of 20 to 39. Of this group, 23.1 million, or 52 percent, had not given birth. The analysis showed that the number of childless women in this age bracket was 5.7 million higher than it would have been if the fertility patterns of 2006 had continued. This represents a rapid acceleration of the trend, with the surplus of childless women growing from 2.1 million in 2016 to 4.7 million in 2022, and now to 5.7 million in 2024.</p><p>The study also illustrates what American families might have looked like if these trends had not occurred. Had pre-recession fertility patterns held steady, an estimated 4.4 million more women aged 20 to 39 would have had two or more children by 2024, and an additional 1.3 million women would have had one child. The cumulative effect of these individual decisions has resulted in a substantial national birth deficit.</p><p>Between 2007 and 2024, there were 11.8 million fewer births in the country than expected. This occurred despite an increase in the number of potential mothers; the population of women aged 20 to 39 grew by 10 percent between 2006 and 2024. Yet, the proportion of this larger group who had never had a child increased by 45 percent.</p><p>The data reveals that these changes are not uniform across all age groups. &ldquo;Childless rates increased the most among women under 30, where fertility rate declines were also greatest,&rdquo; Johnson explained. In contrast, childlessness increased only modestly among women in their 30s. Fertility rates for women in their early 30s saw minimal declines, while rates for women aged 35 to 49 actually increased slightly.</p><p>However, these small gains in childbearing among older women were not nearly enough to offset the massive drop in births among younger women. The research also confirmed that while lower marriage rates account for a significant portion of the rise in childlessness, the number of married women who have not had a child is also higher than historical trends would suggest.</p><p>Looking ahead, the study notes an important limitation: it captures a moment in time and cannot definitively predict the future. It remains possible that some of the women who have so far delayed having children may still go on to have them later in life. The central question is whether this is primarily a delay in childbearing or a permanent increase in the number of women who will forego having children altogether. The substantial and growing number of childless women, particularly as they move through their 30s, suggests that a significant portion may remain childless permanently.</p><p>The implications of this trend, which Johnson and other demographers refer to as the &ldquo;demographic cliff,&rdquo; are far-reaching. &ldquo;The critical question is what kind of impact will this have on society,&rdquo; Johnson stated. A sustained period of lower birth rates affects nearly every aspect of a nation&rsquo;s infrastructure and economy. In the short term, it means a lower demand for schools, child-related businesses, and certain types of health care.</p><p>In the long term, it leads to a smaller workforce, which has profound consequences for economic productivity, innovation, and the tax base needed to support social programs for a growing elderly population. These ongoing shifts in family formation signal a fundamental change in the American demographic landscape, with consequences that will continue to unfold for decades to come.</p><p>The study, &ldquo;<a href="https://carsey.unh.edu/publication/factors-contributing-demographic-cliff-more-us-women-childbearing-age-fewer-have-given-birth">Factors Contributing to the Demographic Cliff: More U.S. Women of Childbearing Age, but Fewer Have Given Birth</a>,&rdquo; was published September 3, 2025.</p></div></section><section class='separator separator-before-comments'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='comments'><p>Top comments</p><ol><li><div class="md"><p>For years society said, Don&#39;t have kids you can&#39;t afford. </p><p>Then society made life with kids unaffordable.

It will also continue to help build a local manufacturing base and supply chain for homegrown enrichment facilities.</p></div><div><p>GLE had earlier said that the Test Loop facility is the world&rsquo;s only uranium enrichment facility that is not government-owned or substantially government-funded.</p><h2>GLE&rsquo;s uranium enrichment demonstration testing</h2><p>GLE was formed in 2007 to develop and commercialize the US&rsquo;s laser-based uranium enrichment technology capability.</p><p>GLE works closely with Silex Systems of Australia, the inventor of the laser enrichment process, to advance the SILEX laser enrichment technology towards commercial launch for uranium enrichment.</p><p>It is jointly owned by Silex Systems Limited (51 percent) and Cameco Corporation (49 percent).</p><p>The <a href="https://interestingengineering.com/energy/worlds-most-advanced-laser-for-uranium">testing program</a> is thought to be a pivotal validation of large-scale enrichment performance under operationally relevant conditions.</p><p>The company plans to leverage the lessons learned from the enrichment test runs to significantly progress the scaling and manufacturing of its full-scale plant systems and equipment.</p></div><div><p>The diversity of fuel designs and levels of enrichment is increasing with the advent of new nuclear reactor technologies, led by small modular and advanced reactors. </p><p>Therefore, having the flexibility to address a broad spectrum of enrichment needs is important to the future growth and diversity of domestic nuclear fuel supply chains.</p><p>Uranium is a naturally occurring element found in deposits across the world. Natural uranium is usually found in the form of two isotopes, U-235 (0.7 percent) and U-238 (99.3 percent).</p><p>Uranium-235 is the isotope that undergoes fission to produce energy in a nuclear reactor. To increase the concentration of the fissile isotopes and make the material more useful for nuclear fuel, uranium typically undergoes a process of concentrating (or &ldquo;enriching&rdquo;) the U-235 isotope to approximately five percent or greater.</p></div><div><h2>Uranium enrichment using lasers for nuclear fuel production</h2><p>In the past, uranium was enriched using the gaseous diffusion process, which is now considered obsolete. The second-generation gas centrifuge technology is mostly used today, which relies on molecular weight differences to separate the uranium isotopes.</p><p>Lasers can also be used to enrich uranium. The process involves lasers selectively exciting and harvesting separately U-235 isotopes from the <a href="https://discoveryalert.com.au/news/laser-enrichment-breakthrough-nuclear-fuel-production-2025/">more common</a> U-238 isotopes, resulting in an increased concentration of U-235 over the initial uranium feedstock.&nbsp;</p><p>The Separation of Isotopes by Laser EXcitation (SILEX) <a href="https://www.gle-us.com/technology/">process promises</a> to economically separate uranium isotopes through highly selective laser excitation of the fluorinated form of uranium &ndash; the&nbsp;235UF&shy;&shy;6&nbsp;isotopic molecule.</p><p>GLE says the SILEX process is substantially <a href="https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/articles/gle-completes-landmark-laser-technology-demonstration">more efficient</a> than existing methods of uranium enrichment and is the only third-generation enrichment technology at an advanced stage of commercialization today.</p></div><div><h4>RECOMMENDED ARTICLES</h4></div><div><p>&ldquo;We believe the enrichment activities conducted over the past five months position GLE to be the next American uranium enrichment solution. Twenty percent of the US electricity supply comes from nuclear energy, and GLE is expected to allow America to end its dangerous dependency on a fragile, foreign government-owned uranium fuel supply chain,&rdquo; said <a href="https://www.gle-us.com/gle-completes-large-scale-enrichment-demonstration-testing/">GLE CEO</a> Stephen Long.</p><p>The company&rsquo;s&nbsp;planned Paducah Laser Enrichment Facility in Kentucky is the only planned new enrichment <a href="https://interestingengineering.com/energy/high-assay-low-enriched-uranium-allocation">facility currently</a> under license application review by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.</p><p>Once licensed, it is expected to re-enrich over 200,000 metric tons of high-assay depleted uranium tails acquired from the US Department of Energy and produce up to 6 million separative work units of LEU annually.</p></div></div><div><h4>ABOUT THE AUTHOR</h4><p><a href="https://interestingengineering.com/author/abhishek-bhardwaj"><strong>Abhishek Bhardwaj</strong></a> Abhishek brings a wealth of experience in covering diverse stories across different beats.
