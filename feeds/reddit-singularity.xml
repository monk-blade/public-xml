Stem cells diminish, making it increasingly difficult for tissues to heal and maintain balance. This reduction in stem cells is a hallmark of aging and a key driver of age-related diseases. Scientists have long debated whether this decline is the root cause of aging or a side effect. Efforts to use stem cell transplants to reverse aging have faced many challenges, such as ensuring the cells survive and integrate into the body without causing serious side effects, like tumors.</p><p>In a recent study published in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2025.05.021"><em>Cell</em></a>, researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Capital Medical University introduced a new type of human stem cell called senescence-resistant mesenchymal progenitor cells (SRCs)&nbsp;by reprogramming&nbsp;the genetic pathways associated with longevity. These cells, which resist aging and stress without developing tumors, were tested on elderly crab-eating macaques, which share physiological similarities with humans in their 60s and 70s.</p><p>The research team conducted a 44-week experiment on&nbsp;these&nbsp;macaques. The macaques received biweekly intravenous injections of SRCs, with a dosage of 2&times;10<sup>6</sup>cells per kilogram of body weight. The researchers found&nbsp;no adverse effects among the macaques. Detailed assessments confirmed that the transplanted cells did not cause tissue damage or tumors.</p><p>The researchers discovered that SRCs&nbsp;triggered a multi-system rejuvenation, reversing key markers of aging across 10 major physiological systems and 61 different tissue types. The treated macaques exhibited improved cognitive function, and tissue analyses indicated a reduction in age-related degenerative conditions such as brain atrophy, osteoporosis, fibrosis, and lipid buildup.</p><p>At the cellular level, SRCs decreased the number of senescent cells, reduced inflammation, and increased progenitor cell populations in neural and reproductive tissues. They even stimulated sperm production. At the molecular level, SRCs enhanced genomic stability, improved responses to oxidative stress, and restored protein balance. More than 50% of the examined tissues showed a reversal of aging-related gene expression profiles to a younger state. Single-cell analyses revealed significant reversals in gene expression among peripheral blood cells (33%), the hippocampus (42%), and ovarian tissue (45%). Machine learning-based aging clocks estimated that the biological age of immature neurons was reversed by six-seven&nbsp;years, and that of oocytes by five&nbsp;years.</p><p>Furthermore, the researchers found that tiny particles called exosomes, released by the SRCs, were the key agents of rejuvenation. These exosomes suppressed chronic inflammation while preserving genomic and epigenomic integrity. When isolated SRC exosomes were administered to aged mice, they significantly reduced organ degeneration. In vitro studies demonstrated that these exosomes could rejuvenate various human cell types, including neurons, ovarian, and liver cells. This discovery suggests that exosome signaling could be a fundamental pathway for reversing aging.</p><p>These findings highlight SRC therapy as a promising intervention for multi-system aging. It&nbsp;demonstrates protective efficacy across interconnected systems like the nervous, reproductive, and immune systems, presenting a holistic approach that surpasses single-target therapies.</p><p><span>SRC Reverses Lipid Buildup in Aged Monkeys' Skeletal Muscle: Control Group (Left); SRC-Treated Group (Right).

class='parsed-content'><div><p>At OpenAI, we&rsquo;re working hard to make AI systems more useful and reliable. Even as language models become more capable, one challenge remains stubbornly hard to fully solve: hallucinations. By this we mean instances where a model confidently generates an answer that isn&rsquo;t true. Our <a href="https://cdn.openai.com/pdf/d04913be-3f6f-4d2b-b283-ff432ef4aaa5/why-language-models-hallucinate.pdf">new research paper&#8288;<span>(opens in a new window)</span></a> argues that language models hallucinate because standard training and evaluation procedures reward guessing over acknowledging uncertainty.</p><p>ChatGPT also hallucinates. GPT&#8209;5 has significantly fewer hallucinations <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5/#:~:text=Building%20a%20more%20robust%2C%20reliable%2C%20and%20helpful%20model">especially when reasoning&#8288;</a>, but they still occur. Hallucinations remain a fundamental challenge for all large language models, but we are working hard to further reduce them.</p><div><h2>What are hallucinations?</h2></div><p>Hallucinations are plausible but false statements generated by language models. They can show up in surprising ways, even for seemingly straightforward questions. For example, when we asked a widely used chatbot for the title of the PhD dissertation by Adam Tauman Kalai (an author of this paper), it confidently produced three different answers&mdash;none of them correct. When we asked for his birthday, it gave three different dates, likewise all wrong.&nbsp;</p><div><h2>Teaching to the test</h2></div><p>Hallucinations persist partly because current evaluation methods set the wrong incentives. While evaluations themselves do not directly cause hallucinations, most evaluations measure model performance in a way that encourages guessing rather than honesty about uncertainty.</p><p>Think about it like a multiple-choice test. If you do not know the answer but take a wild guess, you might get lucky and be right. Leaving it blank guarantees a zero. In the same way, when models are graded only on accuracy, the percentage of questions they get exactly right, they are encouraged to guess rather than say &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p><p>As another example, suppose a language model is asked for someone&rsquo;s birthday but doesn&rsquo;t know. If it guesses &ldquo;September 10,&rdquo; it has a 1-in-365 chance of being right. Saying &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&rdquo; guarantees zero points. Over thousands of test questions, the guessing model ends up looking better on scoreboards than a careful model that admits uncertainty.</p><p>For questions where there is a single &ldquo;right answer,&rdquo; one can consider three categories of responses: accurate responses, errors, and abstentions where the model does not hazard a guess. Abstaining is part of <b>humility</b>, one of <a href="https://openai.com/careers/#:~:text=to%20elevate%20humanity.-,Act%20with%20humility.,-Humility%20reminds%20us">OpenAI&rsquo;s core values&#8288;</a>. Most scoreboards prioritize and rank models based on accuracy, but errors are worse than abstentions. Our <a href="https://model-spec.openai.com/2025-02-12.html#express_uncertainty">Model Spec&#8288;<span>(opens in a new window)</span></a> states that it is better to indicate uncertainty or ask for clarification than provide confident information that may be incorrect.&nbsp;</p><p>In terms of accuracy, the older OpenAI o4-mini model performs slightly better. However, its error rate (i.e., rate of hallucination) is significantly higher. Strategically guessing when uncertain improves accuracy but increases errors and hallucinations.&nbsp;</p><p>When averaging results across dozens of evaluations, most benchmarks pluck out the accuracy metric, but this entails a false dichotomy between right and wrong. On simplistic evals like SimpleQA, some models achieve near 100% accuracy and thereby eliminate hallucinations. However, on more challenging evaluations and in real use, accuracy is capped below 100% because there are some questions whose answer cannot be determined for a variety of reasons such as unavailable information, limited thinking abilities of small models, or ambiguities that need to be clarified.</p><p>Nonetheless, accuracy-only scoreboards dominate leaderboards and model cards, motivating developers to build models that guess rather than hold back. That is one reason why, even as models get more advanced, they can still hallucinate, confidently giving wrong answers instead of acknowledging uncertainty.</p><p>There is a straightforward fix. Penalize confident errors more than you penalize uncertainty, and give partial credit for appropriate expressions of uncertainty. This idea is not new. Some standardized tests have long used versions of negative marking for wrong answers or partial credit for leaving questions blank to discourage blind guessing. Several research groups have also explored evaluations that account for uncertainty and calibration.</p><p>Our point is different. It is not enough to add a few new uncertainty-aware tests on the side. The widely used, accuracy-based evals need to be updated so that their scoring discourages guessing. If the main scoreboards keep rewarding lucky guesses, models will keep learning to guess. Fixing scoreboards can broaden adoption of hallucination-reduction techniques, both newly developed and those from prior research.</p><div><h2>How hallucinations originate from next-word prediction</h2></div><p>We&rsquo;ve talked about why hallucinations are so hard to get rid of, but where do these highly-specific factual inaccuracies come from in the first place? After all, large pretrained models rarely exhibit other kinds of errors such as spelling mistakes and mismatched parentheses. The difference has to do with what kinds of patterns there are in the data.</p><p>Language models first learn through <i>pretraining</i>, a process of predicting the next word in huge amounts of text. Unlike traditional machine learning problems, there are no &ldquo;true/false&rdquo; labels attached to each statement. The model sees only positive examples of fluent language and must approximate the overall distribution.&nbsp;</p><p>It&rsquo;s doubly hard to distinguish valid statements from invalid ones when you don&rsquo;t have any examples labeled as invalid. But even with labels, some errors are inevitable. To see why, consider a simpler analogy. In image recognition, if millions of cat and dog photos are labeled as &ldquo;cat&rdquo; or &ldquo;dog,&rdquo; algorithms can learn to classify them reliably. But imagine instead labeling each pet photo by the pet&rsquo;s birthday. Since birthdays are essentially random, this task would always produce errors, no matter how advanced the algorithm.</p><p>The same principle applies in pretraining. Spelling and parentheses follow consistent patterns, so errors there disappear with scale. But arbitrary low-frequency facts, like a pet&rsquo;s birthday, cannot be predicted from patterns alone and hence lead to hallucinations. Our analysis explains which kinds of hallucinations should arise from next-word prediction. Ideally, further stages after pretraining should remove them, but this is not fully successful for reasons described in the previous section.&nbsp;</p><div><h2>Conclusions</h2></div><p>We hope that the statistical lens in our paper clarifies the nature of hallucinations and pushes back on common misconceptions:</p><div><ul><li><b>Claim:</b> Hallucinations will be eliminated by improving accuracy because a 100% accurate model never hallucinates.<b><br>Finding: </b>Accuracy will never reach 100% because, regardless of model size, search and reasoning capabilities,<b> </b>some real-world questions are inherently unanswerable.&nbsp;</li><li><b>Claim: </b>Hallucinations are inevitable.<b><br>Finding:</b> They are not, because language models can abstain when uncertain.</li><li><b>Claim:</b> Avoiding hallucinations requires a degree of intelligence which is exclusively achievable with larger models.<b><br>Finding:</b> It can be <i>easier</i> for a small model to know its limits. For example, when asked to answer a M&#257;ori question, a small model which knows no M&#257;ori can simply say &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&rdquo; whereas a model that knows some M&#257;ori has to determine its confidence. As discussed in the paper, being &ldquo;calibrated&rdquo; requires much less computation than being accurate.</li><li><b>Claim: </b>Hallucinations are a mysterious glitch in modern language models.<b><br>Finding: </b>We understand the statistical mechanisms through which hallucinations arise and are rewarded in evaluations.</li><li><b>Claim: </b>To measure hallucinations, we just need a good hallucination eval.<b><br>Finding: </b>Hallucination evals have been published. However, a good hallucination eval has little effect against hundreds of traditional accuracy-based evals that penalize humility and reward guessing. Instead, all of the primary eval metrics need to be reworked to reward expressions of uncertainty.</li></ul></div><p>Our latest models have lower hallucination rates, and we continue to work hard to further decrease the rates of confident errors output by our language models.</p></div></section>]]></description><pubDate>Sat, 06 Sep 2025 01:48:25 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://i.redd.it/wjok4efslenf1.jpeg</link><title>Anthropic: Paying $1.5 billion in AI copyright lawsuit settlement (i.redd.it)</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1n9fp0n/anthropic_paying_15_billion_in_ai_copyright/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1n9fp0n/anthropic_paying_15_billion_in_ai_copyright/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1n9fp0n/anthropic_paying_15_billion_in_ai_copyright/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='separator separator-after-permalink'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='selftext'><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/anthropic-copyright-authors-settlement-training-f294266bc79a16ec90d2ddccdf435164">https://apnews.com/article/anthropic-copyright-authors-settlement-training-f294266bc79a16ec90d2ddccdf435164</a></p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section><section class='preview-image'><p>&nbsp;</p><img src='https://i.redd.it/wjok4efslenf1.jpeg' /></section>]]></description><pubDate>Sat, 06 Sep 2025 01:42:30 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.ft.com/content/31feb335-4945-475e-baaa-3b880d9cf8ce</link><title>Computer scientist Geoffrey Hinton: ‘AI will make a few people much richer and most people poorer’ (ft.com)</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1n9ddw7/computer_scientist_geoffrey_hinton_ai_will_make_a/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1n9ddw7/computer_scientist_geoffrey_hinton_ai_will_make_a/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p>Reading time: 2 min | <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1n9ddw7/computer_scientist_geoffrey_hinton_ai_will_make_a/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='separator separator-after-permalink'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='selftext'><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>No paywall <a href="https://archive.ph/ifSwh#selection-1889.0-1889.18">https://archive.ph/ifSwh#selection-1889.0-1889.18</a></p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section><section class='separator separator-after-selftext'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='parsed-content'><div><div><div><p><span></span><span>Subscribe to unlock this article</span></p></div><div><h2><span><span>Try unlimited access</span></span></h2><h2><span><span>Only </span><span>Rs100</span><span> for 4 weeks</span></span></h2><p><span><span>Then </span><span>Rs4335</span><span> per month.

When not working, the two founders slept on air mattresses and pondered the fledgling business&rsquo;s potential. Less than a decade later, the pool house project has reset expectations and plans across the tech industry&rsquo;s highest levels. In June, Mark Zuckerberg handed the now 28-year-old Wang the keys to Meta&rsquo;s entire AI operations as part of a $14.3 billion investment in Scale AI. As Meta&rsquo;s first-ever chief AI officer, Wang now leads a newly formed superintelligence team packed with AI industry superstars paid like high-priced athletes, and oversees Meta&rsquo;s other AI product and research teams&mdash;all under the umbrella of a new organization called <a href="https://fortune.com/company/facebook/">Meta</a> Superintelligence Labs.</p><div><p>This AI dream team, and Wang&rsquo;s role as its captain, mark the latest chapter in a Silicon Valley narrative that&rsquo;s practically a clich&eacute; by now: a new wunderkind rising in tandem with the next world-changing technology. In this case, however, rather than disrupting the old guard, Wang is leaping to action to help an established tech giant, which happens to be run by the previous generation&rsquo;s whiz kid. </p><p>Zuckerberg, the Facebook founder who was worth more than $1 billion by his 23rd birthday, is going all in on AI to maintain the dominance of his 3.4-billion-user-strong social media empire. In addition to spending tens of billions of dollars a year on infrastructure to build the data centers running its AI, the Meta CEO is writing big checks to recruit the world&rsquo;s most sought-after AI talent. Along- side Wang, whom Zuckerberg has called &ldquo;the most impressive founder of his generation,&rdquo; the superintelligence team includes former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman; Daniel Gross, who had been CEO and cofounder of buzzy startup Safe Superintelligence; as well as researchers poached from OpenAI, Anthropic, <a href="https://fortune.com/company/alphabet/">Google</a>, and <a href="https://fortune.com/company/apple/">Apple</a>, with compensation packages for some rumored to be north of $100 million. Ruoming Pang, the engineer in charge of Apple&rsquo;s foundation models team, is reportedly pocketing a whopping $200 million over four years. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m focused on building the most elite and talent-dense team in the industry,&rdquo; Zuckerberg wrote on his Threads app in July. </p><p>The goal of this extraordinary hiring spree? Most pressingly, to reverse Meta&rsquo;s recent struggles in the grueling week-to-week contest for AI market share and mindshare, and to lock in Meta&rsquo;s large language models at the front of the pack. But Wang and his team of super friends have also been tasked with accomplishing something far more ambitious, and something that will be much trickier to measure with ordinary KPIs: to attain the still entirely theoretical concept of &ldquo;superintelligence,&rdquo; leapfrogging ChatGPT-maker OpenAI&mdash;and all other frontier AI competitors&mdash;in the race to define the future of artificial intelligence.</p><hr><p>If the word &ldquo;superintelligence&rdquo; conjures images of omniscient science fiction machines, you&rsquo;re not too far off the mark. </p><p>There is no agreed-upon formal definition of superintelligence, though the term typically refers to an artificial intelligence that vastly surpasses human capabilities in virtually all domains, including scientific creativity, general wisdom, and social skills. </p><p>Superintelligence is generally perceived as going beyond artificial general intelligence, or AGI, which, though also vague, typically refers to an AI system with human-level intelligence across a wide range of work-related tasks. That is, it can reason, plan, solve problems, understand language, and learn in a generalizable way, much like a human. Estimates for achieving AGI vary widely, ranging from a few months to a decade or more; for superintelligence, the timeline ranges from a few years to never. </p><p>Among Silicon Valley&rsquo;s leaders, the mission is spoken about with the assurance of an airplane pilot giving passengers a flight update en route to their destination. </p><p>&ldquo;Developing superintelligence is coming into sight,&rdquo; Zuckerberg wrote in an internal memo obtained by <em>Fortune</em>, though he provided no specific estimate for the date. (OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, for his part, wrote in a June blog post that humanity is now &ldquo;close&rdquo; to building digital superintelligence.)</p><p>Zuckerberg&rsquo;s memo claimed that Meta is &ldquo;uniquely positioned to deliver superintelligence to the world,&rdquo; pointing to the computing power in its data centers versus smaller labs with fewer resources. </p><p>In his July Threads post, Zuckerberg touted Meta&rsquo;s investments in massive, multi-gigawatt data centers with grandiose names (&ldquo;Prometheus&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hyperion&rdquo;) and mind-boggling scale: One of the data centers, Zuck boasted, will have a footprint nearly as big as Manhattan. Meta will &ldquo;invest hundreds of billions of dollars into compute to build superintelligence,&rdquo; Zuckerberg declared. &ldquo;We have the capital from our business to do this.&rdquo; </p><figure><blockquote><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s probably a handful of people in the world that you bet on,&rdquo; says a former Scale AI manager. Wang is one of them.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Of course, a few other notable tech giants have the capital too, and they are dead set on edging Meta out. <a href="https://fortune.com/company/microsoft/">Microsoft</a> and Google are both deploying tens of billions in capital expenditures to build out their AI infrastructure. And OpenAI, in addition to its partnership with Microsoft, has said it intends to invest $500 billion with partners including SoftBank to build out the Stargate network of AI data centers over the next few years. </p><hr><p>In making Wang Chief AI Officer, Meta has chosen someone who is an entrepreneur, not a computer scientist. Even more notable is the fact that the man leading Meta&rsquo;s quest for superintelligence comes from a company that was not in the business of actually building large language models.</p><p>That&rsquo;s not to say that Wang&mdash;a competitive &ldquo;mathlete&rdquo; in high school&mdash;is a cerebral slouch. He&rsquo;s &ldquo;11/10 smart and ambitious&rdquo; and &ldquo;superspecial,&rdquo; says Sarah Guo, founder of VC firm Conviction and former general partner at venture capital firm Greylock, when describing Wang. Guo (no relation to Scale AI cofounder Lucy Guo, who parted ways with Scale in 2018) got to know Scale&rsquo;s founders when they launched their startup from the pool house of her Portola Valley, Calif., home. </p><p>Will Meta&rsquo;s teams of AI PhDs and computer scientists be as impressed and find in Wang the inspiration that drives them to reach the land of superintelligence? </p><p>People close to Wang, including current and former Scale AI employees, investors, acquaintances, and competitors, have emphasized that Wang should not be underestimated in his ability to attract talent and lead Meta&rsquo;s AI organization into the future. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s probably a handful of people in the world that you bet on&rdquo; to build the kind of team Zuckerberg is looking for at Meta, and Wang is on that short list, says a former Scale AI manager who recently left the company. Wang &ldquo;is a great recruiter, a really savvy commercial person.&rdquo; </p><p>Conviction&rsquo;s Guo echoes the sentiment: &ldquo;I think people would be mistaken to underestimate Alex and Nat,&rdquo; she says, referring to Wang and his Meta teammate Nat Friedman. &ldquo;They are very, very smart, ambitious, technical people who are going to listen to their researchers. They are compelling recruiters with a lot of compute and have [Zuckerberg&rsquo;s] insane force of will behind them.&rdquo; An early Scale AI employee, who left in 2022, said that Wang em- bodied the startup&rsquo;s credo of &ldquo;Ambition shapes reality.&rdquo; </p><p>Perhaps that winds back to Wang&rsquo;s childhood as the son of immigrant parents who were nuclear physicists at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico. Wang, whose first name is spelled without the second &ldquo;e&rdquo; to give it the eight characters associated with good fortune in Chinese culture, dropped out of MIT after one year to pursue the startup dream. Wang and Guo had originally planned to create tech for a doctors&rsquo; concierge service, but after joining Y Combinator they saw an opportunity in data&mdash;specifically in the behind-the-scenes, labor- intensive work of tagging and organizing data so that AI models can learn from it.</p><p>Scale&rsquo;s pivot to data labeling, often considered the &ldquo;grunt work&rdquo; that powers AI&rsquo;s intelligence, proved to be perfectly timed and highly valuable because of how critical data is for AI models. &ldquo;Lucy&rsquo;s phone bricked from overheating because she&rsquo;d set up the phone with <a href="https://fortune.com/company/twilio/">Twilio</a> to get a text notification every time a new request came in, and they flooded in so fast once researchers decided they wanted the data,&rdquo; recalls Sarah Guo. </p><hr><p>Meta&rsquo;s relationship with Scale AI dates back to 2019, when the social media company began using Scale as a data provider for its AI efforts, and Meta was among the investors in Scale&rsquo;s $1 billion funding round in 2024. Zuckerberg and Wang began spending more time together beginning in April, when Zuckerberg reached out and expressed a desire to work more closely, according to a source familiar with the negotiations. </p><p>The Meta CEO began inviting Wang (who had become the world&rsquo;s youngest self-made billionaire before turning 25) to meet with him at his houses in Lake Tahoe and Palo Alto, with Zuckerberg soon coming to trust Wang&rsquo;s opinion. Advisors say that Zuckerberg would sometimes reference Wang&rsquo;s views in conversations with them, The Information reported. </p><p>The conversations between the two CEOs came at a time when Zuckerberg was growing frustrated with Meta&rsquo;s struggles keeping up with rival AI labs such as OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google <a href="https://fortune.com/company/deepmind/">DeepMind</a>. Meta had succeeded in creating a family of successful open-source AI models, called Llama, but never seemed able to stay ahead of the pack for long. OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google DeepMind would inevitably surge past Meta with each new update. </p><p>With the release of Llama 4 in April 2025, Meta&rsquo;s malaise became a crisis. Allegations of possibly inflated performance metrics, a rushed release, and a lack of transparency, along with indications that Meta was failing to keep pace with open-source AI rivals like China&rsquo;s DeepSeek, led many in the industry to proclaim Meta&rsquo;s latest AI model a flop. (Meta has called claims that it gamed performance metrics &ldquo;simply not true.&rdquo;)</p><p>And so, even as Wang pushes for future superintelligence, he has the challenging near-term assignment of reinvigorating Meta&rsquo;s current LLM efforts. In the Llama large language models, Meta has a valuable asset and vast resources to draw upon. But as competition intensifies, particularly with upstart rivals from China, Wang will need to make some important strategic decisions, including whether it still makes sense to keep Llama open-source, or whether the changing competitive landscape requires that Meta keep the models&rsquo; weights under lock and key. </p><p>With Wang&rsquo;s firsthand experience building a successful business in the AI sector, the perspective he acquired as a neutral data provider serving the top LLM makers, and his business savvy, fans say he could be the missing ingredient to take Meta&rsquo;s AI efforts to the next level. </p><p>Alex Ren, founding managing partner at Fellows Fund, says that Meta needed an entrepreneur to lead its AI organization&mdash;and it found that in Wang, as well as Friedman and Gross. Meta&rsquo;s AI teams had previously been led by scientists and product managers. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s wrong,&rdquo; says Ren, who counts several of the members of the new superintelligence team as friends. Pointing to OpenAI, and its business-oriented CEO, Sam Altman, Ren says that Meta &ldquo;should really be led by founders and entrepreneurs. Alex Wang is not a researcher, he is a leader.&rdquo; </p><hr><p>With more than $164 billion in annual revenue, Meta knows all too well that it takes something truly unique to move the needle in its business. And in paying up for Wang and his team, Zuckerberg is betting that the ultimate value transcends any simple categories. </p><p>If Wang strikes some as an unconventional choice, reckons one source close to the entrepreneur, it&rsquo;s because he does not fit into the typical tech-world archetypes: &ldquo;Silicon Valley is good at putting people into boxes. They like to say, &lsquo;This person is a technical person, this person is a businessperson.&rsquo; Alex is truly a man of one.&rdquo;</p><p>Few companies could justify pouring billions into speculative AI research and assembling a roster of top-tier talent armed with the latest secret recipes for model success. But Meta can&mdash;and has. Whether that bet pays off is still uncertain. Still, as one current Meta AI research scientist&mdash;who isn&rsquo;t on the new superintelligence team&mdash;told <em>Fortune</em>, if that group makes big leaps in frontier AI over the next six months, &ldquo;everything can be justified.&rdquo; </p><p><em>This article appears in the <a href="https://fortune.com/packages/august-september-2025/">August/September 2025</a> issue of </em>Fortune<em> with the headline &ldquo;Can Alexandr Wang bring Meta AI supremacy?&rdquo;</em></p></div><p><strong>Fortune Global Forum</strong> returns Oct. 26&ndash;27, 2025 in Riyadh.
