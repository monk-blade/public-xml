She&rsquo;s now building a startup, alongside her son, that creates custom machine learning models for marketplaces.&nbsp;</p><p>She called vibe coding a beautiful, endless cocktail napkin on which one can perpetually sketch ideas. But dealing with AI-generated code that one hopes to use in production can be &ldquo;worse than babysitting,&rdquo; she said, as these AI models can mess up work in ways that are hard to predict.&nbsp;</p><p>She had turned to AI coding in a need for speed with her startup, as is the promise of AI tools.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Because I needed to be quick and impressive, I took a shortcut and did not scan those files after the automated review,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;When I did do it manually, I found so much wrong. When I used a third-party tool, I found more. And I learned my lesson.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>She and her son wound up restarting their whole project &mdash; hence the tears. &ldquo;I handed it off like the copilot was an employee,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Rover is like many experienced programmers turning to AI for coding help. But such programmers are also finding themselves acting like AI babysitters &mdash; rewriting and fact-checking the code the AI spits out.&nbsp;</p><div><p>Techcrunch event</p><div><p><span>San Francisco</span> <span>|</span> <span>October 27-29, 2025</span> </p></div></div><p>A recent report by content delivery platform company Fastly <a href="https://www.fastly.com/blog/senior-developers-ship-more-ai-code">found that at least 95%</a> of the nearly 800 developers it surveyed said they spend extra time fixing AI-generated code, with the load of such verification falling most heavily on the shoulders of senior developers.</p><p>These experienced coders have discovered issues with AI-generated code ranging from hallucinating package names to deleting important information and security risks. Left unchecked, AI code can leave a product far more buggy than what humans would produce.</p><p>Working with AI-generated code has become such a problem that it&rsquo;s given rise to a new corporate coding job known as &ldquo;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7370912703231574016/">vibe code cleanup specialist</a>.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>TechCrunch spoke to experienced coders about their time using AI-generated code about what they see as the future of vibe coding. Thoughts varied, but one thing remained certain: The technology still has a long way to go.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Using a coding co-pilot is kind of like giving a coffee pot to a smart six-year-old and saying, &lsquo;Please take this into the dining room and pour coffee for the family,&rsquo;&rdquo; Rover said.&nbsp;</p><p>Can they do it? Possibly. Could they fail? Definitely. And most likely, if they do fail, they aren&rsquo;t going to tell you. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t make the kid less clever,&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;It just means you can&rsquo;t delegate [a task] like that completely.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><h2>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re absolutely right!&rdquo;&nbsp;</h2><p>Feridoon Malekzadeh also compared vibe coding to a child.</p><p>He&rsquo;s worked in the industry for more than 20 years, holding various roles in product development, software, and design. He&rsquo;s building his own startup and heavily using vibe-coding platform Lovable, he said. For fun, he also vibe codes apps like one that generates Gen Alpha slang for Boomers.&nbsp;</p><p>He likes that he&rsquo;s able to work alone on projects, saving time and money, but agrees that vibe coding is not like hiring an intern or a junior coder. Instead, vibe coding is akin to &ldquo;hiring your stubborn, insolent teenager to help you do something,&rdquo; he told TechCrunch.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You have to ask them 15 times to do something,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;In the end, they do some of what you asked, some stuff you didn&rsquo;t ask for, and they break a bunch of things along the way.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Malekzadeh estimates he spends around 50% of his time writing requirements, 10% to 20% of his time on vibe coding, and 30% to 40% of his time on vibe <em>fixing </em>&mdash; remedying the bugs and &ldquo;unnecessary script&rdquo; created by AI-written code.&nbsp;</p><p>He also doesn&rsquo;t think vibe coding is the best at systems thinking &mdash; the process of seeing how a complex problem could impact an overall result. AI-generated code, he said, tries to solve more surface-level problems.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re creating a feature that should be broadly available in your product, a good engineer would create that once and make it available everywhere that it&rsquo;s needed,&rdquo; Malekzadeh said. &ldquo;Vibe coding will create something five different times, five different ways, if it&rsquo;s needed in five different places. It leads to a lot of confusion, not only for the user, but for the model.&rdquo;</p><p>Meanwhile, Rover finds that AI &ldquo;runs into a wall&rdquo; when data conflicts with what it was hard-coded to do. &ldquo;It can offer misleading advice, leave out key elements that are vital, or insert itself into a thought pathway you&rsquo;re developing,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;</p><p>She also found that rather than admit to making errors, it will manufacture results.</p><p>She shared another example with TechCrunch, where she questioned the results an AI model initially gave her. The model started to give a detailed explanation pretending it used the data she uploaded. Only when she called it out did the AI model confess. </p><p>&ldquo;It freaked me out because it sounded like a toxic co-worker,&rdquo; she said.</p><figure><img height="224" width="680" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Rover-example-2.png?w=680" alt srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Rover-example-2.png 1040w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Rover-example-2.png?resize=150,49 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Rover-example-2.png?resize=300,99 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Rover-example-2.png?resize=768,253 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Rover-example-2.png?resize=680,224 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Rover-example-2.png?resize=430,141 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Rover-example-2.png?resize=720,237 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Rover-example-2.png?resize=900,296 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Rover-example-2.png?resize=800,263 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Rover-example-2.png?resize=668,220 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Rover-example-2.png?resize=708,233 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Rover-example-2.png?resize=50,16 50w"></figure> <figure><img height="383" width="680" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Rover-example-3.png?w=680" alt srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Rover-example-3.png 1068w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Rover-example-3.png?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Rover-example-3.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Rover-example-3.png?resize=768,433 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Rover-example-3.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Rover-example-3.png?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Rover-example-3.png?resize=720,406 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Rover-example-3.png?resize=900,507 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Rover-example-3.png?resize=800,451 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Rover-example-3.png?resize=668,377 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Rover-example-3.png?resize=665,375 665w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Rover-example-3.png?resize=708,399 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Rover-example-3.png?resize=50,28 50w"></figure><p>On top of this, there are the security concerns.</p><p>Austin Spires is the senior director of developer enablement at Fastly and has been coding since the early 2000s.&nbsp;</p><p>He&rsquo;s found through his own experience &mdash; along with chatting with customers &mdash; that vibe code likes to build what is quick rather than what is &ldquo;right.&rdquo; This may introduce vulnerabilities to the code of the kind that very new programmers tend to make, he said.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;What often happens is the engineer needs to review the code, correct the agent, and tell the agent that they made a mistake,&rdquo; Spires told TechCrunch. &ldquo;This pattern is why we&rsquo;ve seen the trope of &lsquo;you&rsquo;re absolutely right&rsquo; appear over social media.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>He&rsquo;s referring to how AI models, like Anthropic Claude, tend to respond &ldquo;you&rsquo;re absolutely right&rdquo; when called out on their mistakes.</p><p>Mike Arrowsmith, the chief technology officer at the IT management software company NinjaOne, has been in software engineering and security for around 20 years. He said that vibe coding is creating a new generation of IT and security blind spots to which young startups in particular are susceptible.</p><p>&ldquo;Vibe coding often bypasses the rigorous review processes that are foundational to traditional coding and crucial to catching vulnerabilities,&rdquo; he told TechCrunch.</p><p>NinjaOne, he said, counters this by encouraging &ldquo;safe vibe coding,&rdquo; where approved AI tools have access controls, along with mandatory peer review and, of course, security scanning.&nbsp;</p><h2>The new normal</h2><p>While nearly everyone we spoke to agrees that AI-generated code and vibe-coding platforms are useful in many situations &mdash; like mocking up ideas &mdash; they all agree that human review is essential before building a business on it.</p><p>&ldquo;That cocktail napkin is not a business model,&rdquo; Rover said. &ldquo;You have to balance the ease with insight.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>But for all the lamenting on its errors, vibe coding has changed the present and the future of the job.&nbsp;</p><p>Rover said vibe coding helped her tremendously in crafting a better user interface. Malekzadeh simply said that, despite the time he spends fixing code, he still gets more done with AI coders than without them.</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Every technology carries its own negativity, which is invented at the same time as technical progress,&rdquo; Malekzadeh said, quoting the French theorist Paul Virilio, who spoke about inventing the shipwreck along with the ship.</p><figure><blockquote><p>The pros far outweigh the cons.</p></blockquote></figure><p>The Fastly survey found that senior developers were twice as likely to put AI-generated code into production compared to junior developers, saying that the technology helped them work faster.&nbsp;</p><p>Vibe coding is also part of Spires&rsquo; coding routine. He uses AI coding agents on several platforms for both front-end and back-end personal projects. He called the technology a mixed experience but said it&rsquo;s good in helping with prototyping, building out boilerplate, or scaffolding out a test; it removes menial tasks so that engineers can focus on building, shipping, and scaling products.&nbsp;</p><p>It seems the extra hours spent combing through the vibe weeds will simply become a tolerated tax on using the innovation.</p><p>Elvis Kimara, a young engineer, is learning that now. He just graduated with a master&rsquo;s in AI and is building an AI-powered marketplace.&nbsp;</p><p>Like many coders, he said vibe coding has made his job harder and has often found vibe coding a joyless experience.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no more dopamine from solving a problem by myself. The AI just figures it out,&rdquo; he said. At one of his last jobs, he said senior developers didn&rsquo;t look to help young coders as much&nbsp;&mdash; some not understanding new vibe-coding models, while others delegated mentorship tasks to said AI models.</p><p>But, he said, &ldquo;the pros far outweigh the cons,&rdquo; and he&rsquo;s prepared to pay the innovation tax.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t just be writing code; we&rsquo;ll be guiding AI systems, taking accountability when things break, and acting more like consultants to machines,&rdquo; Kimara said of the new normal for which he&rsquo;s preparing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Even as I grow into a senior role, I&rsquo;ll keep using it,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a real accelerator for me. I make sure I review every line of AI-generated code so I learn even faster from it.&rdquo;</p></div></section>]]></description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 02:06:46 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://i.redd.it/9x9pn2u9f0pf1.png</link><title>Demis Hassabis celebrates Gemini hitting #1 on the appstore (i.redd.it)</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1ngaw86/demis_hassabis_celebrates_gemini_hitting_1_on_the/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1ngaw86/demis_hassabis_celebrates_gemini_hitting_1_on_the/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1ngaw86/demis_hassabis_celebrates_gemini_hitting_1_on_the/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='preview-image'><img src='https://i.redd.it/9x9pn2u9f0pf1.png' /></section>]]></description><pubDate>Sun, 14 Sep 2025 04:09:25 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://v.redd.it/55p7hljv4wof1</link><title>Demis argues that it’s nonsense to claim current models are "PhD intelligences” (Video)</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1nfs49p/demis_argues_that_its_nonsense_to_claim_current/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1nfs49p/demis_argues_that_its_nonsense_to_claim_current/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1nfs49p/demis_argues_that_its_nonsense_to_claim_current/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='embedded-media'><video controls preload='auto' autoplay='false'><source src='https://v.redd.it/55p7hljv4wof1/HLSPlaylist.m3u8?a=1760571050%2CODRkY2I2ZmRhNjM5Y2ViMTA0YzdmZGEwYmVmNzkzODRlODgxMTcyMDI0MTIzNmQ0MGNmNjAzMTBhZjJlZDI1Nw%3D%3D&amp;v=1&amp;f=sd' type='video/mp4' width='960' height='720'><img src='' alt='' /></video></section>]]></description><pubDate>Sat, 13 Sep 2025 13:50:23 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://i.redd.it/vhuiper0jtof1.png</link><title>Within 40 min codex-cli with GPT-5 high made  fully working NES emulator in pure c!

Doug McMillon, Walmart CEO, started off with a summer gig helping to unload trucks. It's a similar story for GM CEO Mary Barra, who began on the assembly line at the automaker as an 18-year old. Those are the kinds of career ladder success arcs that have inspired workers, and Hollywood, but as AI is set to replace many entry-level jobs, it may also write that corporate character out of the plot. </p><p>The rise of AI has coincided with considerable <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/15/amazon-and-the-endangered-future-of-the-middle-manager.html">organizational flattening</a>, especially among middle management ranks. At the same time, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei is among those who forecast 50% of entry-level jobs may be wiped out by AI as the technology improves, including <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/03/ai-jobs-work-anthropic-human-replacement.html">being able to work eight-hour shifts without a break</a>. </p><p>All the uncertainty in the corporate org chart introduced by AI &mdash; occurring at a time when <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/09/job-market-is-trash-right-now-career-coach-says-heres-why.html">college graduates are struggling to find roles</a> &mdash; raises the question of whether the career ladder is about to be broken, and the current generation of corporate leaders' tales of ascent that have always made up an important part of the corporate American ethos set to become a thing of the past. If the notion of going from the bottom to the top has always been more the exception than the rule, it has helped pump the heart of America's corporations. In the least, removing the first rung on the ladder raises important questions about the transfer of institutional knowledge and upward advancement in organizations.</p><p>Looking at data between 2019 and 2024 for the biggest public tech firms and maturing venture-capital funded startups, venture capital firm SignalFire found in <a href="https://www.signalfire.com/blog/signalfire-state-of-talent-report-2025">a study</a> there was a 50% decline in new role starts by people with less than one year of post-graduate work experience: "Hiring is intrinsically volatile year on year, but 50% is an accurate representation of the hiring delta for this experience category over the considered timespan," said Asher Bantock, head of research at SignalFire. The data ranged across core business functions &mdash; sales, marketing, engineering, recruiting/HR, operations, design, finance and legal &mdash; with the 50% decline consistent across the board. </p><p>But Heather Doshay, partner at SignalFire, says the data should not lead job seekers to lose hope. "The loss of clear entry points doesn't just shrink opportunities for new grads &mdash; it reshapes how organizations grow talent from within," she said. </p><p>If, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LNyUbii0zw">as Amodei told</a> CNBC earlier this year, "At some point, we are going to get to AI systems that are better than almost all humans at almost all tasks," the critical question for workers is how the idea of an entry-level job can evolve as AI continues to.</p><p>Flatter organizations seem certain. "The ladder isn't broken &mdash; it's just being replaced with something that looks a lot flatter," Doshay said. In her view, the classic notion of a CEO rising from the mailroom is a perfect example since at many company's it's been a long time since anyone worked in an actual mailroom. "The bottom rung is disappearing," she said, "but that has the potential to uplevel everyone."</p><p>The new "entry level" might be a more advanced or skilled role, but with the upskilling of the bottom rung, pressure is being created for new grads to acquire these job skills on their own, rather than being able to learn them while already on a job they can't land today. That should not be a career killer, though, according to Doshay.</p><p>"When the internet and email came on the scene as common corporate required skills, new grads were well-positioned to become experts by using them in school, and the same absolutely applies here with how accessible AI is," she said. "The key will be in how new grads harness their capabilities to become experts so they are seen as desirable tech-savvy workers who are at the forefront of AI's advances," she said.</p><p>But she concedes that may not offer much comfort to the current crop of recent grads looking for jobs right now. "My heart goes out to the new grads of 2024, 2025, and 2026, as they are entering during a time of uncertainty," Doshay said, describing it is a much more vulnerable group entering the workforce than ones further into the future.</p><p>Universities are turning their schools into<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/07/technology/chatgpt-openai-colleges.html"> AI training grounds</a>, with several institutions<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/03/openai-anthropic-target-college-students-with-education-ai-services.html"> striking major deals</a> with companies like Anthropic and OpenAI.</p><div><p>"Historically, technological advancements have not harmed employment rates in the long run, but there are short-term impacts along the way," Doshay said. "The entry-level careers of recent graduates are most affected, which could have lasting effects as they continue to grow their careers with less experience while finding fewer job opportunities," she added.</p><p>Anders Humlum, assistant professor of economics at the University of Chicago, says predictions about AI's long-term labor market impact remain highly speculative, and firms are only<a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w33777"> just beginning</a> to adjust to the new generative AI landscape. "We now have two and a half years of experience with generative AI chatbots diffusing widely throughout the economy," Humlum said, adding "these tools have really not made a significant difference for employment or earnings in any occupation thus far."</p></div><p>Looking at the history of labor and technology, he says even the most transformative technologies, such as steam power, electricity, and computers took decades to generate large-scale economic effects. As a result, any reshaping of the corporate structure and culture will take time to become clear.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>"Even if Amodei is correct that AI tools will eventually match the technical capabilities of many entry-level white-collar workers, I believe his forecast underestimates both the time required for workflow adjustments and the human ability to adapt to the new opportunities these tools create," Humlum said.</p><p>But a key challenge for businesses is ensuring that the benefits of these tools are broadly shared across the workforce. In particular, Humlum said, his research shows a substantial gender gap in the use of generative AI. "Employers can significantly reduce this gap by actively encouraging adoption and offering training programs to support effective use," he said.</p><p>Other AI researchers worry that the biggest issue won't be the career ladder at the lowest rung, but ultimately, the stability of any rung at all, all the way to the top. </p><p>If predictions about AI advancements ultimately leading to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/10/meta-scale-ai-alex-wang.html">superintelligence</a> are proven correct, Max Tegmark, president of the Future of Life Institute, says the issue isn't going to be about whether the 50% entry-level jobs being wiped out is accurate, but that percentage growing to 100% for all careers, "since superintelligence can by definition do all jobs better than us," he said.</p><p>In that world, even if you were the last call center, distribution center or assembly line worker to make it to the CEO desk, your days of success might be numbered. "If we continue racing ahead with totally unregulated AI, we'll first see a massive wealth and power concentration from workers to those who control the AI, and then to the machines themselves as their owners lose control over them," Tegmark said.</p></div></section>]]></description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Sep 2025 19:55:25 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nd44y6</link><title>Seedance-4-edit ended my profession (Gallery)</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1nd44y6/seedance4edit_ended_my_profession/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1nd44y6/seedance4edit_ended_my_profession/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p>Reading time: 1 min | <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1nd44y6/seedance4edit_ended_my_profession/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='separator separator-after-permalink'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='selftext'><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Guys, it’s a wrap.
