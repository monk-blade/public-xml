China is determined to be self reliant on key fields like AI and Chips, and aims at beating foreign companies like Nvidia in the market. It will be just like how Huawei and other Chinese local smartphone companies pushed Apple and Google out of China and developing countries once they catch up. Buying Nvidia has been just to bridge the gap before their local GPU can compete, or worse to help IP thief and reverse engineering.</p><p>At best, Nvidia can take a few years of profits from China, but it risks reverse engineering and accelerating their AI model developments. Nevertheless once they catch up, they will push Nvidia out of not just China, but also any China-friendly markets in the world like the Middle East. It actually makes more sense to guard Nvidia trade secret strictly to slow down the market takeover.</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1njdx1y/nvidia_ceo_says_hes_disappointed_after_report/neqyeza/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><div class="md"><p>lol owned.
