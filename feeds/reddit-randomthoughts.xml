Volunteering to be exact. </p><p>Depression causes your brain to be stuck on a repetitive, distorted, negative, thought-loop. </p><p>And since you are incessantly focusing on those same old, distorted thought-loops, you stay in your head 24/7. And since you can&#39;t be in 2 places at once,  you effectively &quot;drop out&quot; of your physical surroundings. </p><p>But volunteering disrupts this  because helping an elderly person, a homeless person or an animal, forces you to think about something else for a while.</p><p>It helps you, and the person you&#39;re helping.

But the hopeless feeling like you&#39;ll never get better is a symptom, not a fact. I read &quot;Feel Good (or Feeling Good) ths New Mood therapy&quot; and it actually helped. It gives exercises for combating the thoughts, it&#39;s CBT. </p><p>The important thing is to force yourself to do something to take care of yourself even when you&#39;re depressed. I like going on walks when I&#39;m low. I can go as slow or fast as I like, listen to music or a podcast. The movement and the outside air helps. Best wishes to you. You&#39;ll absolutely come out the other side again, we always do.</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/RandomThoughts/comments/1nk7huy/depression_is_so_much_harder_to_get_out_of_than/nevvshk/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p></li></ol></section>]]></description><pubDate>Thu, 18 Sep 2025 18:24:15 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/RandomThoughts/comments/1njoc9y/people_working_40_hour_work_weeks_cant_possibly/</link><title>People working 40 hour work weeks can't possibly be happy.</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/RandomThoughts/comments/1njoc9y/people_working_40_hour_work_weeks_cant_possibly/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/RandomThoughts/comments/1njoc9y/people_working_40_hour_work_weeks_cant_possibly/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p>Reading time: 1 min | <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/RandomThoughts/comments/1njoc9y/people_working_40_hour_work_weeks_cant_possibly/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='separator separator-after-permalink'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='selftext'><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I‚Äôm two weeks in and I cannot imagine enjoying life when you spend practically most of your time either sleeping or working.
