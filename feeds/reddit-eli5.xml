I did a quick comparison against gold, and it&#39;s almost half the value(~58,000 USD per Pound or ~128,000 USD per KG). I can understand how, in the past, it may have been expensive with spice trade stuff. </p><p>Why is it so absurdly expensive in this day and age? Even more important, what&#39;s keeping it from being mass-produced like other spices? Thanks!</p><p>Edit: wow! Lots of responses really quick, thank you all! </p><p>As a Tldr; for people who just want to read and go, basically it is a very fragile crocus flower that requires very specific environmental conditions and produces a significantly small yield per plant.
