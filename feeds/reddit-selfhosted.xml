Bruno is interesting because it stores everything in plain text, which makes version control with Git a lot easier. Hoppscotch caught my eye too since it’s open source and can be self-hosted if you want it running in your own setup. I also gave Hurl a shot, which is neat if you’re comfortable with the CLI since it uses text files for defining API calls.</p><p>Some people suggested Yaak (from the original Insomnia founder) and also Insomnium, which is basically a community fork of Insomnia before the company started changing things. On the more old-school side, there’s SoapUI, which still works fine if you need SOAP and complex testing.

Thanks to feedback from this community, the project has grown into a more complete warranty and document management system.</p><p>Warracker is a self-hosted web app for organizing product warranties, receipts, and related documents. It helps you track purchase details, set reminders before coverage expires, and store everything in one place. It supports multi-user setups, OIDC single sign-on, and integrates directly with Paperless-ngx for hybrid document storage.</p><p>Since the last post, a lot has been added:</p><ul><li>Full <strong>warranty claims management</strong> with lifecycle tracking (statuses, resolutions, dates)</li><li><strong>Localization support</strong> for 17 languages, including RTL and instant language switching</li><li><strong>Proactive alerts</strong> with email and push service integration through Apprise</li><li>A <strong>status dashboard</strong> with charts and analytics for both global and per-user views</li><li>Expanded warranty records: multiple serial numbers, tags, product photos, detailed notes</li><li>Stronger admin tools: role-based permissions, CSV import/export, and custom settings</li></ul><p>Warracker is still in active beta, but the core features are stable and already being used daily. Docker setup is provided in the repo, along with example configs to get started quickly.</p><p>If you want to try it out or get involved:<br/>GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/sassanix/warracker">https://github.com/sassanix/warracker</a>.

We believe the actual impact of this incident is limited; however, action is required from you to ensure your account remains secure.</p><p>What happened</p><p>An unauthorized third party accessed a limited subset of customer data from one of our databases. While we quickly contained the incident, information that was accessed included emails, usernames, and securely hashed passwords.</p><p>Any account passwords that may have been accessed were securely hashed, in accordance with best practices, meaning they cannot be read by a third party. Out of an abundance of caution, we recommend you immediately reset your password by visiting <a href="https://plex.tv/reset">https://plex.tv/reset</a>. Rest assured that we do not store credit card data on our servers, so this information was not compromised in this incident.</p><p>What we&#39;re doing</p><p>We&#39;ve already addressed the method that this third party used to gain access to the system, and we&#39;re undergoing additional reviews to ensure that the security of all of our systems is further hardened to prevent future attacks.</p><p>What you must do</p><p>We kindly request that you reset your Plex account password immediately by visiting <a href="https://plex.tv/reset">https://plex.tv/reset</a>. When doing so, there&#39;s a checkbox to &quot;Sign out connected devices after password change,&quot; which we recommend you enable. This will sign you out of all your devices (including any Plex Media Server you own) for your security, and you will then need to sign back in with your new password. We understand that this means a little more work for you, but it will provide additional security to your account.</p><p>Additional Security Measures You Can TakeWe remind you that no one at Plex will ever reach out to you over email to ask for a password or credit card number for payments. For further account protection, we also recommend enabling two-factor authentication on your Plex account if you haven’t already done so.</p><p>Lastly, we sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this situation may cause you. We take pride in our security systems, which helped us quickly detect this incident, and we want to assure you that we are working swiftly to prevent potential future incidents from occurring.</p><p>For step-by-step instructions on how to reset your password, visit: <a href="https://support.plex.tv/articles/account-requires-password-reset">https://support.plex.tv/articles/account-requires-password-reset</a></p><p>Thank you,</p><p>The Plex Team</p></blockquote></div><!-- SC_ON --></section>]]></description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Sep 2025 03:00:19 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1nbzzzq/how_frequently_do_you_update_your/</link><title>How frequently do you update your containers/programs?

It supports standalone ebooks and audiobooks (with mobile app and web reader/listener support coming soon!), advanced search and sort functions, and a wide array of features for managing your library’s metadata and organizing your collections. And you can now point Storyteller at your existing &quot;books&quot; folder and have it automatically import books as they&#39;re added to your filesystem.</p><p>Oh, and we support OAuth and OIDC, now!</p><p>Take a look at the blog post or <a href="https://storyteller-platform.gitlab.io/storyteller/docs/managing-your-library/">the new docs</a> for some more detail about what&#39;s new!</p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section>]]></description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Sep 2025 02:01:35 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1nbqvye/turn_your_iphone_into_a_powerful_selfhosted_ocr/</link><title>Turn Your iPhone Into a Powerful Self-Hosted OCR Server</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1nbqvye/turn_your_iphone_into_a_powerful_selfhosted_ocr/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1nbqvye/turn_your_iphone_into_a_powerful_selfhosted_ocr/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p>Reading time: 2 min | <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1nbqvye/turn_your_iphone_into_a_powerful_selfhosted_ocr/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='separator separator-after-permalink'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='selftext'><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted">r/selfhosted</a>!

One point that I have not seen discussed online or on YouTube is the attack surface of either codebase or the amount of disclosed exploits, which is what I want to discuss today.</p><p>I&#39;ve been trying to settle on an IdP that supports <code>forward-auth</code> , WebAuthn and RBAC, both of which are covered nicely in both solutions.</p><p>However, comparing recent disclosed exploits between the two, Authentik has <strong>22</strong> in comparison to Authelia&#39;s <strong>3</strong>, <strong>11</strong> of which are in the high-critical band in comparison to only <strong>1</strong> for Authelia.</p><h1>Authentik Vulnerabilities</h1><p>Here&#39;s few notable CVEs from Authentik&#39;s codebase:</p><ul><li><a href="https://app.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2024-47070">CVE-2024-47070</a> - “bypassing password login by adding X-Forwarded-For header with an unparsable IP address, e.g. <code>a</code>. This results in a possibility of logging into any account with a known login or email address.”<ul><li>This could be easily mitigated by sanitising headers at the reverse proxy level, which is considered best practice, as this exploit requires Authentik to trust the source.</li></ul></li><li><a href="https://app.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2024-37905">CVE-2024-37905</a> - “Authentik API-Access-Token mechanism can be exploited to gain admin user privileges. A successful exploit of the issue will result in a user gaining full admin access to the Authentik application, including resetting user passwords and more.”<ul><li>Utilising a WAF to block any request to <code>/api/v3/core/tokens*</code> would mitigate this exploit, however this hardening step is not documented, even in the Authentik docs (see Hardening Authentik, <a href="https://docs.goauthentik.io/security/security-hardening/">https://docs.goauthentik.io/security/security-hardening/</a>).</li></ul></li><li><a href="https://app.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2022-46145">CVE-2022-46145</a> - “vulnerable to unauthorized user creation and potential account takeover. With the default flows, unauthenticated users can create new accounts in authentik.

I have a pretty simple machine, an Intel i3 (4th gen) with an RTX 1650 4GB GPU not too power-hungry.</p><p>Since my GPU was underused, I decided to install <a href="https://ollama.com">Ollama</a>, a tool that allows running AI models locally. After testing Ollama, I quickly realized that 4GB wasn’t enough to run the latest models.</p><h1>Hardware Upgrade</h1><p>With this new problem, I now had the perfect excuse to upgrade my other machine the one I use for gaming. After a lot of research, I managed to get a good deal on an RX 7900 XTX. Now I have 24GB to run the latest models. But I was surprised by its power consumption, easily pulling <del>over 300 watts</del> around 45 watts in idle. This raised a red flag: keeping this machine on 24/7 would be far from energy-efficient.</p><h1>Initial Idea</h1><p>What if I had a way to power on the machine only when I needed it? I’d need another device to manage it. A Raspberry Pi would be perfect, since I could leave it running 24/7 (its power draw is minimal), and it could turn the power-hungry machine on and off.</p><h1>Wake-on-LAN</h1><p>With that in mind, I started looking into ways to remotely turn my machine on. That’s when I discovered Wake-on-LAN, or simply WoL. After configuring my motherboard and operating system, I was able to power on my machine remotely with this simple command:</p><pre><code>wakeonlan &lt;MAC_ADDRESS&gt;</code></pre><p>Because of how WoL works, it sends a “magic packet” over the local network  meaning you need to be on the same LAN to wake the machine. That’s fine, one less problem. Now I could turn the machine on remotely, which led to the next question: when do I need to power it on? The answer was simple whenever I needed to access services running on it, like Ollama or any other self-hosted service.</p><h1>Intercepting Traffic</h1><p>Most services use a specific port, such as 11434 for Ollama (where it opens a TCP connection). I thought of using a reverse proxy to intercept the traffic and, when necessary, wake the server. Once the server was online, the proxy could redirect the traffic to it. Perfect! Now we’d have the ability to wake the server remotely only when needed.</p><pre><code>sequenceDiagram    participant User as User    participant Proxy as Reverse Proxy (Wakezilla)    participant Server as Server (Ollama - port 11434)    User-&gt;&gt;Proxy: TCP Request (port 11434)    Proxy-&gt;&gt;Server: Check if online    alt Server OFF        Proxy-&gt;&gt;Server: Send Wake-on-LAN (power on server)        Server--&gt;&gt;Proxy: Server initialized    end    Proxy-&gt;&gt;Server: Redirect traffic    Server--&gt;&gt;Proxy: Response    Proxy--&gt;&gt;User: Return data</code></pre><h1>When to Shut Down the Server?</h1><p>Now that we can remotely power on the server, we also need to decide when to shut it down. I don’t want it running 24/7, so I thought, since we’re already intercepting traffic, why not monitor it? When no more requests come in, the server can be shut down. By adding a requests-per-minute threshold, if no requests are made, the server can be turned off.</p><h1>How to Do This?</h1><p>After some research, I didn’t find many tools that did exactly what I wanted, so I decided to build my own solution. Since the target machine would need some software anyway to receive the shutdown command, I kept it simple: a CLI that starts a small web server. When it receives an unauthenticated HTTP request (for now), it shuts down the machine. I also added a health check so the reverse proxy can verify whether the machine is online.</p><h1>Wakezilla</h1><p>With that in mind, I built Wakezilla, a simple tool that does exactly this: it intercepts traffic, wakes the server with WoL when needed, and powers it down when there’s no more traffic. All of this in a straightforward way, written in Rust, packaged as a single binary with no external dependencies, making it easy to use anywhere.</p><h1>Open Source Project</h1><p>The project is available on GitHub, and contributions are welcome, whether to add new features or improve documentation. If you’d like to try it out, just follow the instructions in the project’s README. If you have any questions, feel free to open an issue, and I’ll be happy to help.

I started out by installing <a href="https://ollama.com/">Ollama</a> on my Fedora (KDE Plasma DE) workstation with a Ryzen 7 5800X CPU, Radeon 6700XT GPU, and 32GB of RAM. </p><p>Initially, I had to add the following to the systemd ollama.service file to get GPU compute working properly: </p><pre><code>[Service]Environment=&quot;HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION=10.3.0&quot;</code></pre><p>Once I got that solved I was able to run the Deepseek-r1:latest model with 8-billion parameters with a pretty high level of performance. I was honestly quite surprised! </p><p>Next, I spun up an instance of Open WebUI in a podman container, and setup was very minimal. It even automatically found the local models running with Ollama. </p><p>Finally, the open-source Android app, Conduit gives me access from my smartphone. </p><p>As long as my workstation is powered on I can use my self-hosted AI from anywhere. Unfortunately, my NAS server doesn&#39;t have a GPU, so running it there is not an option for me. I think the privacy benefit of having a self-hosted AI is great. </p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section>]]></description><pubDate>Sun, 07 Sep 2025 21:15:00 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/bsp01i/welcome_to_rselfhosted_please_read_this_first/</link><title>Welcome to /r/SelfHosted!

Taking away the &quot;unknown&quot; factor in how your data is managed and stored, this provides those with the willingness to learn and the mind to do so to take control of their data without losing the functionality of services they otherwise use frequently. </p><h2>Some Examples</h2><p>For instance, if you use dropbox, but are not fond of having your most sensitive data stored in a data-storage container that you do not have direct control over, you may consider NextCloud</p><p>Or let&#39;s say you&#39;re used to hosting a blog out of a Blogger platform, but would rather have your own customization and flexibility of controlling your updates? Why not give WordPress a go. </p><p>The possibilities are endless and it all starts here with a server. </p><h2>Subreddit Wiki</h2><p>There have been varying forms of a wiki to take place. While currently, there is no <em>officially</em> hosted wiki, we do have a <a href="https://github.com/r-selfhosted/wiki">github repository</a>. There is also at least one unofficial mirror that showcases the live version of that repo, listed on the index of the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/wiki">reddit-based wiki</a></p><h2>Since You&#39;re Here...</h2><p>While you&#39;re here, take a moment to get acquainted with our few but important <strong><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/wiki/rules">rules</a></strong></p><p>And if you&#39;re into Discord, <a href="https://discord.gg/UrZKzYZfcS">join here</a></p><p>When posting, please apply an appropriate flair to your post.
