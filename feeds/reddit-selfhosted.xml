I started out by installing <a href="https://ollama.com/">Ollama</a> on my Fedora (KDE Plasma DE) workstation with a Ryzen 7 5800X CPU, Radeon 6700XT GPU, and 32GB of RAM. </p><p>Initially, I had to add the following to the systemd ollama.service file to get GPU compute working properly: </p><pre><code>[Service]Environment=&quot;HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION=10.3.0&quot;</code></pre><p>Once I got that solved I was able to run the Deepseek-r1:latest model with 8-billion parameters with a pretty high level of performance. I was honestly quite surprised! </p><p>Next, I spun up an instance of Open WebUI in a podman container, and setup was very minimal. It even automatically found the local models running with Ollama. </p><p>Finally, the open-source Android app, Conduit gives me access from my smartphone. </p><p>As long as my workstation is powered on I can use my self-hosted AI from anywhere. Unfortunately, my NAS server doesn&#39;t have a GPU, so running it there is not an option for me. I think the privacy benefit of having a self-hosted AI is great. </p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section>]]></description><pubDate>Sun, 07 Sep 2025 21:15:00 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1naljd8/benefits_of_hosting_a_password_manager_in_2025_vs/</link><title>Benefits of hosting a password manager in 2025 vs Chrome's manager</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1naljd8/benefits_of_hosting_a_password_manager_in_2025_vs/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1naljd8/benefits_of_hosting_a_password_manager_in_2025_vs/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p>Reading time: 1 min | <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1naljd8/benefits_of_hosting_a_password_manager_in_2025_vs/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='separator separator-after-permalink'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='selftext'><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I went through some of the older posts and was wondering what are the benefits of hosting a password manager besides the obvious of having control of your data?</p><p>I mean so I mostly use Chrome (sometimes Firefox), have an Android phone and Chrome&#39;s internal password manager seems to work fine for the most part.

But let&#39;s dig into some changes we can start working with.</p><h2>AI-Related Content</h2><p>First and foremost, the official subreddit stance:</p><p><strong><em><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted">/r/selfhosted</a> allows the sharing of tools, apps, applications, and services, assuming any post related to AI follows all other subreddit rules</em></strong></p><p>Here are some updates on how posts related to AI are to be handled from here on, though. </p><p>For now, there seem to be 4 major classifications of AI-related posts. </p><ol><li>Posts <em>written</em> with AI. </li><li>Posts about vibe-coded apps with minimal/no peer review/testing</li><li>AI-built apps that otherwise follow industry standard app development practices</li><li>AI-assisted apps that feature AI as part of their function. </li></ol><p><strong><em>ALL 4 ARE ALLOWED</em></strong></p><p>I will say this again. None of the above examples are disallowed on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted">/r/selfhosted</a>. If someone elects to use AI to write a post that they feel better portrays the message they&#39;re hoping to convey, that is their perogative. Full-stop. </p><p>Please stop reporting things for &quot;AI-Slop&quot; (inb4 a bajillion reports on this post for AI-Slop, unironically). </p><p>We do, however, require flair for these posts. In fact...</p><h2>Flair Requirements</h2><p>We are now enforcing flair across the board. Please report unflaired content using the new report option for <a href="https://mort.cc/074fw217d25.png">Missing/Incorrect flair.</a></p><p>On the subject of Flair, if you believe a flair option is not appropriate, or if you feel a different flair option should be available, please <a href="https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/selfhosted&amp;subject=Post%20Flair%20Request">message the mods</a> and make a request. We&#39;d be happy to add new flair options if it makes sense to do so.</p><h2>Mod Applications</h2><p><strong>As of 8/11/2025, we have brought on the desired number of moderators for this round.</strong> Subreddit activity will continue to be monitored and new mods will be brought on as needed. </p><p>Thanks all!</p><p><del>Finally, we need mods. Plain and simple. The ones we have are active when they can be, but the growth of the subreddit has exceeded our team&#39;s ability to keep up with it.</del></p><p><del>The primary function we are seeking help with is mod-queue and mod mail responses.</del> </p><p><del>Ideal moderators should be kind, courteous, understanding, thick-skinned, and adaptable. We are not perfect, and no one will ever ask you to be. You will, however, need to be slow to anger, able to understand the core problem behind someone&#39;s frustration, and help solve that, rather than fuel the fire of the frustration they&#39;re experiencing.</del></p><p><del>We can help train moderators. The rules and mindset of how to handle the rules we set are fairly straightforward once the philosophy is shared. Being able to communicate well and cordially under any circumstance is the harder part; difficult to teach.</del></p><p><del><a href="https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/selfhosted&amp;subject=Moderator%20Interest">message the mods</a> if you&#39;d like to be considered. I expect to select a few this time around to participate in some mod-mail and mod-queue training, so please ensure you have a desktop/laptop that you can use for a consistent amount of time each week. Moderating from a mobile device (phone or tablet) is possible, but difficult.</del> </p><h2>Wrap Up</h2><p>Longer than average post this time around, but it has been...a while. And a lot has changed in a very short period. Especially all of this new talk about AI and its effect on the internet at large, and specifically its effect on this subreddit. </p><p>In any case, that&#39;s all for today!</p><p>We appreciate you all for being here and continuing to make this subreddit one of my favorite places on the internet. </p><p>As always, </p><p>happy (self)hosting. ;)</p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section>]]></description><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jul 2025 12:37:35 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/bsp01i/welcome_to_rselfhosted_please_read_this_first/</link><title>Welcome to /r/SelfHosted!

Taking away the &quot;unknown&quot; factor in how your data is managed and stored, this provides those with the willingness to learn and the mind to do so to take control of their data without losing the functionality of services they otherwise use frequently. </p><h2>Some Examples</h2><p>For instance, if you use dropbox, but are not fond of having your most sensitive data stored in a data-storage container that you do not have direct control over, you may consider NextCloud</p><p>Or let&#39;s say you&#39;re used to hosting a blog out of a Blogger platform, but would rather have your own customization and flexibility of controlling your updates? Why not give WordPress a go. </p><p>The possibilities are endless and it all starts here with a server. </p><h2>Subreddit Wiki</h2><p>There have been varying forms of a wiki to take place. While currently, there is no <em>officially</em> hosted wiki, we do have a <a href="https://github.com/r-selfhosted/wiki">github repository</a>.
