It’s smart enough to understand things like &quot;next Tuesday at 8 a.m.&quot; or &quot;two weeks from now on Thursday&quot; by using the recording&#39;s date as a reference. You can then export these events as a standard calendar file (.ics) and add them straight to your Google Calendar, Outlook, or whatever you use.</p><p><strong>Create your own transcript export formats</strong></p><p>I also added a new template system so you can format your exported transcripts exactly how you need them. This is really useful if you need a specific layout for meeting notes, video subtitles, or just a simple, clean text file. You can build your own templates using placeholders like <code>{{speaker}}</code> and <code>{{text}}</code>, and there are even filters to do things like make text uppercase or format timestamps correctly for SRT files.</p><p>It&#39;s all open-source and self-hostable, as always.

This is a powerful feature that will allow users to monitor workflows (create item -&gt; get item -&gt; update item -&gt; verify item has been updated -&gt; delete item) will failsafes to ensure clean up even on failure (e.g. having the delete item step always run even if earlier steps failed). I&#39;m very excited for that feature, as I&#39;ve been wanting to implement this since Gatus was first created. It&#39;s currently on master/latest and will have to soak for some time due to the size of the changes that had to be made to the overall source code. After all, while I love new features, I hate breaking changes for end users more.</p><p>Anyways, I&#39;m not very good at advertising my project and I&#39;ve seen many people post their updates on this subreddit, so I figured I&#39;d participate. </p><p>If anybody has questions, please don&#39;t hesitate!</p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section><section class='embedded-media'><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/qurnydotfzof1.jpg?width=2560&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=81b4d67ca05ba1a96908a1bf29eeadffed350fba" height="1760" width="2560" /></p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/zokuayutfzof1.jpg?width=2538&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e00e8356994e260a9c1d366940b5c3b47fc8c15" height="860" width="2538" /></p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/tke4mlytfzof1.jpg?width=1630&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=065e3e265d2e4a5e855da8cb2ca26d38df4f4d9a" height="1190" width="1630" /></p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/m5e7tu2ufzof1.jpg?width=1308&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5bc8e2dd4e855d163d30f9f6df22c35401386898" height="1738" width="1308" /></p></section>]]></description><pubDate>Sun, 14 Sep 2025 00:50:41 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1ng5q22/i_hate_dns_providers_that_wont_let_you_export/</link><title>I hate DNS providers that won't let you export your own records</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1ng5q22/i_hate_dns_providers_that_wont_let_you_export/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1ng5q22/i_hate_dns_providers_that_wont_let_you_export/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p>Reading time: 1 min | <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1ng5q22/i_hate_dns_providers_that_wont_let_you_export/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='separator separator-after-permalink'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='selftext'><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>...Or basically every domain registrar ever.

Initially I lazed out the issue, and a week ago there was a fix for a very similar issue that shipped with v1.41.1 so I checked it but it didn&#39;t actually fix my issue (it was Beta timeline so I didn&#39;t care as much initially) so I finally decided to open an issue about it. </p><p>Also I think it is a good thing that I opened that issue cause now (with v1.42.0) the Beta timeline is being defaulted for the apps. I think it&#39;s a bit too soon IMO but after that issue got resolved hopefully there aren&#39;t any other big issues.  </p><p>Love Immich team! and special thanks to shenlong-tanwen my man is working 24/7 on that repo</p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section>]]></description><pubDate>Sat, 13 Sep 2025 16:45:14 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://i.redd.it/18pcikgnysof1.png</link><title>Any idea why Jellyfin makes so many DNS queries?

I was shocked by the lack of tools in the academia world, especially those related to Papers search, annotation, reading ... etc. So I decided to create my own. It&#39;s self-hosted on Docker.</p><p><strong>Paperion contains 80 million papers</strong> in Elastic Search. What&#39;s different about it, is I digested a big number of paper&#39;s content into the database, thus making the recommendation system the most accurate there is online. I also added a section for annotation, where you simply save a paper, open it in a special reader and highlight your parts and add notes to them and find them all organized in Notes tab. Also organizing papers in collections. Of course any paper among the 80mil can be downloaded in one click. I added a feature to summarize the papers with one click.</p><p><strong>It&#39;s open source too, find it on Github :</strong> <a href="https://github.com/blankresearch/Paperion">https://github.com/blankresearch/Paperion</a></p><p>Don&#39;t hesitate to leave a star ! Thank youuu</p><p>Check out the project doc here : <a href="https://www.blankresearch.com/Paperion/">https://www.blankresearch.com/Paperion/</a></p><p><strong>Tech Stack :</strong> Elastic Search, Sqlite, FastAPI, NextJS, Tailwind, Docker.</p><p><strong>Project duration :</strong> It took me almost 3 weeks of work from idea to delivery. 8 days of design ( tech + UI ) 9 days of development, 5 days for Note Reader only ( it&#39;s tricky ).</p><p><strong>Database :</strong> The most important part is the DB. it&#39;s 50Gb ( zipped ), with all 80mil metadata of papers, and all economics papers ingested content in text field paperContent ( you can query it, you can search in it, you can do anything you do for any text ). The goal in the end is to have it ingest all the 80 million papers. It&#39;s going to be huge.</p><p>The database is available on demand only, as I&#39;m seperating the data part from the docker so it doesn&#39;t slow it down. It&#39;s better to host it on a seperated filesystem.</p><p><strong>Who is concerned with the project :</strong> Practically everyone. Papers are consumed nowadays by everyone as they became more digestible, and developers/engineers of every sort became more open to read about scientific progress from its source. But the ideal condidate for this project are people who are in academia, or in a research lab or company like ( AI, ML, DL ... ).</p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section><section class='embedded-media'><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/i5eqr4rispof1.png?width=2880&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c80769def8063ab2d57c8367f7eb2193f4e48f62" height="1614" width="2880" /></p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/n6flx4rispof1.png?width=2880&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ddb7892ea4dc87e27cbcb9f965b77a5cdb241744" height="1619" width="2880" /></p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/dpyfw7rispof1.png?width=2880&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c0e07aa31d7c80ad8c5247b74a5b75914569b866" height="1620" width="2880" /></p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/jth608rispof1.png?width=2880&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0a4bd4945ca8bb45822fa441cf6efacb74799617" height="1616" width="2880" /></p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/d0lr68rispof1.png?width=2880&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a3decd7278b82512419508a98ead647429c3b049" height="1617" width="2880" /></p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/7kpouarispof1.png?width=2880&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=85fb5cd74f78dcbdd34c4ca6f839bc5b431366ee" height="1616" width="2880" /></p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/yn9h5brispof1.png?width=2880&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f2ecf35a523e1e778e953db27438ea711a1b9601" height="1615" width="2880" /></p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/1zltfarispof1.png?width=2880&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a9cf0de66f32106499d01cd13a259fa47ecfbda0" height="1616" width="2880" /></p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/y2hs6brispof1.png?width=2880&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a78fa827c50cb315e67d4a46396552734e3f491d" height="1618" width="2880" /></p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/xjdjyarispof1.png?width=2880&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7118c88009d6d92cbd6ccfc8e3688fad1dceaa41" height="1617" width="2880" /></p></section>]]></description><pubDate>Fri, 12 Sep 2025 16:24:46 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1nc0hto/plex_breached_20250909_action_required_notice_of/</link><title>Plex Breached 2025-09-09: "Action required: Notice of a potential security incident"</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1nc0hto/plex_breached_20250909_action_required_notice_of/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1nc0hto/plex_breached_20250909_action_required_notice_of/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p>Reading time: 2 min | <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1nc0hto/plex_breached_20250909_action_required_notice_of/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='separator separator-after-permalink'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='selftext'><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Thanks <a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/LeftBus3319">/u/LeftBus3319</a> + <a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/FnnKnn">/u/FnnKnn</a></p><ol><li><p><a href="https://plex.tv/reset">Reset your Plex account password immediately</a>, making sure to check &quot;Sign out connected devices after password change&quot;</p></li><li><p>To <a href="https://support.plex.tv/articles/204281528-why-am-i-locked-out-of-server-settings-and-how-do-i-get-in/">reclaim your server</a> you can use SSH Tunneling to get access to <em>your server&#39;s</em> localhost:32400 on your <em>personal</em> host with <code>ssh -L 32400:localhost:32400 serverUser@serverHost</code> - <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1nc0hto/plex_breached_20250909_action_required_notice_of/nd62qn0/">link</a></p></li></ol><hr/><p>Announcement page:<a href="https://links.plex.tv/s/vb/Vn7XtnwDSSaqqDUYoHu1P57ZgZ1FsHgTO2PTIBl6jEOUiHBH3LGmI3nLdDfopQa54PatUwZQhT0Bz8rKAi--jTM4ATdsBHpe4c1Yljr89VkoCOavEGH5wn5Fi_filLNeOMo-lnNqLSLpJpI/lOe98S8UWKdmPnp9StQz9R1-kOSTpWhr/12">https://links.plex.tv/s/vb/Vn7XtnwDSSaqqDUYoHu1P57ZgZ1FsHgTO2PTIBl6jEOUiHBH3LGmI3nLdDfopQa54PatUwZQhT0Bz8rKAi--jTM4ATdsBHpe4c1Yljr89VkoCOavEGH5wn5Fi_filLNeOMo-lnNqLSLpJpI/lOe98S8UWKdmPnp9StQz9R1-kOSTpWhr/12</a></p><p>Announcement screenshot:<a href="https://i.imgur.com/0PMRvVY.png">https://i.imgur.com/0PMRvVY.png</a></p><blockquote><p>Dear Plex User,</p><p>We have recently experienced a security incident that may potentially involve your Plex account information. We believe the actual impact of this incident is limited; however, action is required from you to ensure your account remains secure.</p><p>What happened</p><p>An unauthorized third party accessed a limited subset of customer data from one of our databases. While we quickly contained the incident, information that was accessed included emails, usernames, and securely hashed passwords.</p><p>Any account passwords that may have been accessed were securely hashed, in accordance with best practices, meaning they cannot be read by a third party. Out of an abundance of caution, we recommend you immediately reset your password by visiting <a href="https://plex.tv/reset">https://plex.tv/reset</a>. Rest assured that we do not store credit card data on our servers, so this information was not compromised in this incident.</p><p>What we&#39;re doing</p><p>We&#39;ve already addressed the method that this third party used to gain access to the system, and we&#39;re undergoing additional reviews to ensure that the security of all of our systems is further hardened to prevent future attacks.</p><p>What you must do</p><p>We kindly request that you reset your Plex account password immediately by visiting <a href="https://plex.tv/reset">https://plex.tv/reset</a>. When doing so, there&#39;s a checkbox to &quot;Sign out connected devices after password change,&quot; which we recommend you enable. This will sign you out of all your devices (including any Plex Media Server you own) for your security, and you will then need to sign back in with your new password. We understand that this means a little more work for you, but it will provide additional security to your account.</p><p>Additional Security Measures You Can TakeWe remind you that no one at Plex will ever reach out to you over email to ask for a password or credit card number for payments. For further account protection, we also recommend enabling two-factor authentication on your Plex account if you haven’t already done so.</p><p>Lastly, we sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this situation may cause you. We take pride in our security systems, which helped us quickly detect this incident, and we want to assure you that we are working swiftly to prevent potential future incidents from occurring.</p><p>For step-by-step instructions on how to reset your password, visit: <a href="https://support.plex.tv/articles/account-requires-password-reset">https://support.plex.tv/articles/account-requires-password-reset</a></p><p>Thank you,</p><p>The Plex Team</p></blockquote></div><!-- SC_ON --></section>]]></description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Sep 2025 03:00:19 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/bsp01i/welcome_to_rselfhosted_please_read_this_first/</link><title>Welcome to /r/SelfHosted!
