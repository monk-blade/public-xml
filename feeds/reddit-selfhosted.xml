I didn’t realize just how many parts of my daily routine were tied to them until I started digging in. Email, calendar, contacts, photo backups, even random logins all seemed to go back to a Google account somewhere.</p><p>I started small with email. Instead of relying on Gmail, I set up my own domain and pointed it to a mail server I could control. Took some trial and error, but now I can handle my own accounts, aliases, and storage. For calendars and contacts, I moved to CalDAV and CardDAV, syncing across devices with a simple self-hosted service. It’s not as flashy as Google Calendar, but it works without handing everything over.</p><p>Photos and files were supposed to be the next step, so I decided to set up Nextcloud… but honestly, I’m not figuring it out. Between permissions issues, slow performance, and sync errors, I feel like I spend more time troubleshooting than actually using it. I know it’s capable of replacing Drive, Photos, Notes, and more, but so far I haven’t managed to get it stable enough to trust with my data.</p><p>The hardest part has been deciding what’s worth the effort to self-host and what’s better left alone. Some swaps have been straightforward, but others (like Nextcloud) have made me realize just how much Google’s convenience hides behind the scenes but I also don&#39;t want my data everywhere, tired of everything being an info dump so they can sell me anything I talk about. </p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section>]]></description><pubDate>Fri, 19 Sep 2025 16:25:57 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1nkynm9/opensource_tool_to_organize_adult_content/</link><title>Open-source tool to organize adult content [NSFW]</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1nkynm9/opensource_tool_to_organize_adult_content/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1nkynm9/opensource_tool_to_organize_adult_content/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p>Reading time: 1 min | <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1nkynm9/opensource_tool_to_organize_adult_content/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='separator separator-after-permalink'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='selftext'><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone!</p><p>I&#39;ve developed a software to organize and view personal adults movie collection.</p><p>This tool is called ZobTube and aims to help sorting movies by kind (or length), adding actors, categories and channels.</p><p>It aims to be highly customizable, allowing setting everything to match personal preferences.</p><p>It is only available as self-hosted, aka you run it yourself, on your own computer/server.</p><p>It is open-sourced and is based on open-source technologies.</p><p>Feel free to give it a try!</p><p><a href="https://github.com/zobtube/zobtube">https://github.com/zobtube/zobtube</a></p><p>If you have any question, feel free to jump on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/zobtube/">r/zobtube</a></p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section>]]></description><pubDate>Fri, 19 Sep 2025 14:41:19 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1nkn457/tired_of_youtube_music_heres_how_i_migrated_to/</link><title>Tired of YouTube Music?

I couldn&#39;t find a tool that did exactly what I needed, so I built my own.</p><p>It&#39;s a simple Docker-based tool called YMDE. Here’s a quick rundown of the features:</p><ul><li><strong>Processes Google Takeout</strong>: Works directly with your YouTube Music <code>JSON</code> or <code>CSV</code> playlist files.</li><li><strong>Efficient Downloads</strong>: Uses <code>yt-dlp</code> with parallel processing to download everything quickly.</li><li><strong>Clean Organization</strong>: Saves files in a <code>Playlist Name/Track Title.ext</code> structure.</li><li><strong>Metadata &amp; Thumbnails</strong>: Automatically embeds metadata and video thumbnails into the audio files.</li><li><strong>Playlist Generation</strong>: Creates <code>.m3u8</code> playlists, so media servers like Jellyfin or Plex can import them instantly.</li><li><strong>Smart Deduplication</strong>: Avoids re-downloading tracks that are in multiple playlists.</li></ul><p>My main goal was to create a clean, tagged library that I could just point Jellyfin to. You can run it once and copy the files over, or map your Jellyfin music folder directly in the <code>compose.yml</code> for a seamless sync. No more being locked into Google&#39;s ecosystem.</p><p>The project is still new, but it&#39;s working great for my setup. If you&#39;re trying to do something similar, I&#39;d love for you to check it out and give me some feedback.</p><p>You can find it on GitHub here: <a href="https://github.com/WarreTh/YMDE">WarreTh/YMDE</a></p><p>Let me know what you think</p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section>]]></description><pubDate>Fri, 19 Sep 2025 04:28:33 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1nk5ier/are_there_any_benefits_drawbacks_to_putting_all/</link><title>Are there any benefits /drawbacks to putting all of your dockers in 1 compose file?</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1nk5ier/are_there_any_benefits_drawbacks_to_putting_all/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1nk5ier/are_there_any_benefits_drawbacks_to_putting_all/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p>Reading time: 1 min | <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1nk5ier/are_there_any_benefits_drawbacks_to_putting_all/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='separator separator-after-permalink'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='selftext'><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>New to self hosting and just wondering if there any benefits/drawbacks to putting all of your dockers in 1 compose file?</p><p>Or related dockers together?

While it doesn&#39;t cover everything we do at work, within permissible limits, we can achieve a lot using various freeware platforms.</p><p>I’ve been tightening my external access and would love feedback on the design, trade-offs, and any “gotchas” you see.</p><p>Here is an expanded version of the project.</p><h1>My Zero-Trust Homelab: Cloudflare Access ↔ Authentik (OIDC + YubiKey), Cloudflared Tunnels, Tailscale for Admin, step-ca for Internal TLS</h1><p>I wanted enterprise-style “default-deny” for my homelab without sacrificing usability on the road. This is the design I landed on after a lot of iteration. Posting the full rationale and layout because I don’t see many security-first homelab write-ups.</p><h1>Goals (and why)</h1><ul><li><strong>Zero-trust at the edge</strong>: every public request must prove identity before it can even touch an app.</li><li><strong>Hardware-backed auth</strong>: I want phishing-resistant WebAuthn/YubiKey. Passwords are the fallback, not the default.</li><li><strong>No open inbound ports</strong>: everything uses an outbound tunnel (Cloudflared) or a private overlay (Tailscale).</li><li><strong>Separate public vs. admin paths</strong>: day-to-day portals go through the edge; admin planes (hypervisor, backup, OOB) are VPN-only.</li><li><strong>First-class internal TLS</strong>: private services get real certs from my own CA (step-ca) and auto-renew through my reverse proxy.</li><li><strong>Simple to operate</strong>: as few moving parts as possible for a single-operator lab.</li><li>High-level architecture (redacted IPs &amp; domains)</li></ul><p>Use <a href="http://mydomain.com"><code>mydomain.com</code></a> wherever you see a hostname. Example private IPs are in the <code>10.10.x.x</code> space.</p><ul><li><strong>Edge &amp; tunnel</strong><ul><li><strong>Cloudflare</strong>: DNS, WAF, and <strong>Zero Trust Access</strong>.</li><li><strong>Cloudflared Tunnel</strong> from a small VM inside LAN (no inbound NAT required).</li></ul></li><li><strong>Identity</strong><ul><li><strong>Authentik</strong> (OIDC provider), enforcing <strong>WebAuthn (YubiKey)</strong>; OTP is the fallback.</li><li>Cloudflare Access uses Authentik as the IdP. Short session TTLs.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Public apps (behind Access)</strong><ul><li>Pi-hole (2 instances), Immich, Portainer, Homepage, OctoPrint, Speedtest, Stream, etc.</li><li>Each private service listens on <code>10.10.x.x</code> and is published via Cloudflared → Cloudflare Access policy.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Admin-only apps (no public path)</strong><ul><li>Proxmox VE (<code>10.10.1.80</code>), Proxmox Backup (<code>10.10.1.87</code>), TrueNAS, Unraid, iDRAC.</li><li><strong>Tailscale</strong> overlay provides access; these FQDNs are not published via the tunnel.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Private PKI &amp; reverse proxy</strong><ul><li><strong>step-ca</strong> (internal CA) at <a href="http://10.10.1.240"><code>10.10.1.240</code></a> issues internal server certs.</li><li><strong>Caddy</strong> reverse proxy at <a href="http://10.10.1.200"><code>10.10.1.200</code></a> terminates TLS, requests/renews certs from step-ca automatically (ACME).</li></ul></li><li><strong>DNS path</strong><ul><li><strong>Unbound</strong> + <strong>NextDNS</strong> as upstreams for LAN, with separate rules for clients.</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Other architecture:</strong></p><p><strong>Firewall</strong>: UDM-SE</p><p><strong>Switch</strong>: UniFi 48 Enpterrise grade. 5 different Vlans with extremely segmentation for each vlan.</p><p>Several <strong>AP</strong> in the mix: some tied to specific Vlans.</p><h1>Request flows (how a packet actually gets in)</h1><h1>Public user → Pi-hole Admin (replace with any public app)</h1><ol><li>Browser hits <code>https://pihole.mydomain.com</code>.</li><li><strong>Cloudflare Edge (WAF + Access)</strong> evaluates policy → challenges with <strong>OIDC</strong>.</li><li><strong>Authentik</strong> prompts for <strong>WebAuthn (YubiKey)</strong> (OTP fallback if needed); returns token to Access.</li><li>Access injects session → forwards through <strong>Cloudflared Tunnel</strong> to the LAN.</li><li>Caddy routes to the service (optional), or cloudflared goes directly to the app.</li><li>App responds over the tunnel; the browser never sees the LAN IP.</li></ol><h1>Admin user → Proxmox VE</h1><ul><li>User connects to <strong>Tailscale</strong>; then uses <a href="https://10.10.1.80"><code>https://10.10.1.80</code></a> (or an internal FQDN).</li><li>No Cloudflare/Cloudflared in the path.

Public apps are <strong>identity-gated at the edge</strong>. No unauthenticated request reaches a service.</li><li><strong>Cred protection</strong>: WebAuthn/YubiKey significantly reduces phishing and credential stuffing risks.</li><li><strong>Op simplicity</strong>: Cloudflared keeps inbound closed; Tailscale “just works” for admin; step-ca gives painless internal TLS.</li><li><strong>Resilience</strong>: If Authentik is down, public logins pause but the apps keep running; admin still works through Tailscale.</li></ul><h1>What I didn’t do (and why)</h1><ul><li><strong>mTLS at Cloudflare</strong>: powerful, but requires the right plan/feature set.

Even if you don&#39;t use Plex or AniList, you might find the <a href="https://github.com/eliasbenb/PlexAniBridge-Mappings">mappings database</a> this project spawned interesting.</p><p>So, I built this project because I wanted my Plex watch progress and AniList to stay in sync without manual effort - which is why I spent the last year working on something to save me a couple of minutes of effort. Anyways, I also wanted to avoid the pitfalls the existing solutions have - they either rely on fragile title search, require manual AniList to Plex mappings, or are overly simplistic and miss out on a lot of useful fields. This fixes all of that, and a lot more.</p><p>PlexAniBridge runs alongside your Plex server and keeps AniList and Plex aligned: watch status, episode progress, started/completed dates, ratings, reviews, watchlists, rewatch counts, etc. It&#39;s very customizable; it can be conservative, aggressive, or destructive if you explicitly opt in.</p><p>First of all, arguably the most impressive feature of PlexAniBridge is its <a href="https://github.com/eliasbenb/PlexAniBridge-Mappings">curated anime mappings database</a> (shoutout to <a href="https://github.com/LuceoEtzio">Luceo</a> for contributing to so much of the mappings 🤲). This database is a separate repository that contains mappings for, as of September 17, 2025, 19,916 AniList entires. For context the entire AniList database only has <a href="https://anilist.co/site-stats">~21K</a> entries. That&#39;s 94.8% coverage! The coverage is so great that title-based fuzzy search is disabled by default (but can be opted-in). In fact, my personal library has 99.98% coverage; the kicker? That stat is for episode/movie coverage - not entire shows/seasons. Yes, 99.98% of my EPISODES are mapped to AniList, including special seasons. Okay, I just had to nerd-out about that. Thank you again to Luceo on GitHub for the awesome work on this database.</p><h1>Core features</h1><ul><li>Multi-profile: you can setup multiple profiles with dozens of distinct settings and customization (maybe too much); sync different Plex servers, libraries, and accounts to different AniList users</li><li>Sync modes: you can do interval-based scans, poll for changes, or use Plex webhooks for instant updates; or any combination of those</li><li>Per-field control: Exclude any fields (e.g. score or notes) from being synced to AniList if you want to keep them separate</li><li>Web UI: there&#39;s a really nice web UI to look at sync history, stats, and manage mappings (unfortunately no web UI for configuration yet, but it&#39;s coming, hopefully)</li><li>Automatic AniList backups (JSON snapshots) + included restore functionallity through the UI or a CLI script</li><li>Undo: every sync operation is recorded with before/after state; selected operations can be undone via the UI</li><li>Custom mappings: add or override mappings through the UI or by dropping JSON files in the data dir</li><li>Smart matching: Uses a curated anime mappings DB first. Title search fallback is disabled by default; you can turn it on and control how strict (0–100 similarity threshold)</li><li>Local vs &quot;online&quot; Plex metadata mode: honestly, this feature isn&#39;t that stable, but I thought I&#39;d mention it since it&#39;s helped some users before; online mode can be used to query the Plex metadata server for when data in your local Plex server is incomplete or missing</li><li>Dockerized: easy to deploy, minimal dependencies, single container</li><li>More features to come 🔥</li></ul><h1>Nerd stuff</h1><p>Skip this if you don&#39;t care about the nitty-gritty or if you&#39;re not a nerd like me :-)</p><ul><li>Python (FastAPI + SQLAlchemy + async stack), Svelte frontend (served as a static SPA)</li><li>SQLite for internal state and history tracking</li><li>Caching layers: very intelligent caching to memoize and minimize API calls to AniList and Plex</li><li>Rate limit handling: automatic retries with backoff for AniList API limits (seriously how is it still 30 / minute in 2025)</li></ul><h1>Links</h1><ul><li>Repo: <a href="https://github.com/eliasbenb/PlexAniBridge">https://github.com/eliasbenb/PlexAniBridge</a></li><li>Docs: <a href="https://plexanibridge.elias.eu.org">https://plexanibridge.elias.eu.org</a></li><li>Mappings DB: <a href="https://github.com/eliasbenb/PlexAniBridge-Mappings">https://github.com/eliasbenb/PlexAniBridge-Mappings</a></li><li>Discord (chat/help): <a href="https://discord.gg/ey8kyQU9aD">https://discord.gg/ey8kyQU9aD</a></li></ul><p>Note: this project is intended for use with the official Plex Metadata agents. Third-party agents (e.g. HAMA) are not supported and may lead to unexpected behavior.</p><p>If this scratches the same itch for you, spin it up, run a dry run, and see if your list settles into shape. Now, fire away with questions.</p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section><section class='preview-image'><p>&nbsp;</p><img src='https://i.redd.it/x85efw7c6spf1.png' /></section>]]></description><pubDate>Thu, 18 Sep 2025 01:36:45 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://i.redd.it/zml26e8owppf1.png</link><title>Self-hosted Start Page - Flame (i.redd.it)</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1njbyi7/selfhosted_start_page_flame/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1njbyi7/selfhosted_start_page_flame/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p>Reading time: 1 min | <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1njbyi7/selfhosted_start_page_flame/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='separator separator-after-permalink'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='selftext'><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I found this start-page that can be self-hosted in a Docker container, and so far I love it!

We believe the actual impact of this incident is limited; however, action is required from you to ensure your account remains secure.</p><p>What happened</p><p>An unauthorized third party accessed a limited subset of customer data from one of our databases. While we quickly contained the incident, information that was accessed included emails, usernames, and securely hashed passwords.</p><p>Any account passwords that may have been accessed were securely hashed, in accordance with best practices, meaning they cannot be read by a third party. Out of an abundance of caution, we recommend you immediately reset your password by visiting <a href="https://plex.tv/reset">https://plex.tv/reset</a>. Rest assured that we do not store credit card data on our servers, so this information was not compromised in this incident.</p><p>What we&#39;re doing</p><p>We&#39;ve already addressed the method that this third party used to gain access to the system, and we&#39;re undergoing additional reviews to ensure that the security of all of our systems is further hardened to prevent future attacks.</p><p>What you must do</p><p>We kindly request that you reset your Plex account password immediately by visiting <a href="https://plex.tv/reset">https://plex.tv/reset</a>. When doing so, there&#39;s a checkbox to &quot;Sign out connected devices after password change,&quot; which we recommend you enable. This will sign you out of all your devices (including any Plex Media Server you own) for your security, and you will then need to sign back in with your new password. We understand that this means a little more work for you, but it will provide additional security to your account.</p><p>Additional Security Measures You Can TakeWe remind you that no one at Plex will ever reach out to you over email to ask for a password or credit card number for payments. For further account protection, we also recommend enabling two-factor authentication on your Plex account if you haven’t already done so.</p><p>Lastly, we sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this situation may cause you. We take pride in our security systems, which helped us quickly detect this incident, and we want to assure you that we are working swiftly to prevent potential future incidents from occurring.</p><p>For step-by-step instructions on how to reset your password, visit: <a href="https://support.plex.tv/articles/account-requires-password-reset">https://support.plex.tv/articles/account-requires-password-reset</a></p><p>Thank you,</p><p>The Plex Team</p></blockquote></div><!-- SC_ON --></section>]]></description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Sep 2025 03:00:19 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/bsp01i/welcome_to_rselfhosted_please_read_this_first/</link><title>Welcome to /r/SelfHosted!
