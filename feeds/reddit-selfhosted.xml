I have a pretty simple machine, an Intel i3 (4th gen) with an RTX 1650 4GB GPU not too power-hungry.</p><p>Since my GPU was underused, I decided to install <a href="https://ollama.com">Ollama</a>, a tool that allows running AI models locally. After testing Ollama, I quickly realized that 4GB wasn’t enough to run the latest models.</p><h1>Hardware Upgrade</h1><p>With this new problem, I now had the perfect excuse to upgrade my other machine the one I use for gaming. After a lot of research, I managed to get a good deal on an RX 7900 XTX. Now I have 24GB to run the latest models. But I was surprised by its power consumption, easily pulling <del>over 300 watts</del> around 45 watts in idle. This raised a red flag: keeping this machine on 24/7 would be far from energy-efficient.</p><h1>Initial Idea</h1><p>What if I had a way to power on the machine only when I needed it? I’d need another device to manage it. A Raspberry Pi would be perfect, since I could leave it running 24/7 (its power draw is minimal), and it could turn the power-hungry machine on and off.</p><h1>Wake-on-LAN</h1><p>With that in mind, I started looking into ways to remotely turn my machine on. That’s when I discovered Wake-on-LAN, or simply WoL. After configuring my motherboard and operating system, I was able to power on my machine remotely with this simple command:</p><pre><code>wakeonlan &lt;MAC_ADDRESS&gt;</code></pre><p>Because of how WoL works, it sends a “magic packet” over the local network  meaning you need to be on the same LAN to wake the machine. That’s fine, one less problem. Now I could turn the machine on remotely, which led to the next question: when do I need to power it on? The answer was simple whenever I needed to access services running on it, like Ollama or any other self-hosted service.</p><h1>Intercepting Traffic</h1><p>Most services use a specific port, such as 11434 for Ollama (where it opens a TCP connection). I thought of using a reverse proxy to intercept the traffic and, when necessary, wake the server. Once the server was online, the proxy could redirect the traffic to it. Perfect! Now we’d have the ability to wake the server remotely only when needed.</p><pre><code>sequenceDiagram    participant User as User    participant Proxy as Reverse Proxy (Wakezilla)    participant Server as Server (Ollama - port 11434)    User-&gt;&gt;Proxy: TCP Request (port 11434)    Proxy-&gt;&gt;Server: Check if online    alt Server OFF        Proxy-&gt;&gt;Server: Send Wake-on-LAN (power on server)        Server--&gt;&gt;Proxy: Server initialized    end    Proxy-&gt;&gt;Server: Redirect traffic    Server--&gt;&gt;Proxy: Response    Proxy--&gt;&gt;User: Return data</code></pre><h1>When to Shut Down the Server?</h1><p>Now that we can remotely power on the server, we also need to decide when to shut it down. I don’t want it running 24/7, so I thought, since we’re already intercepting traffic, why not monitor it? When no more requests come in, the server can be shut down. By adding a requests-per-minute threshold, if no requests are made, the server can be turned off.</p><h1>How to Do This?</h1><p>After some research, I didn’t find many tools that did exactly what I wanted, so I decided to build my own solution. Since the target machine would need some software anyway to receive the shutdown command, I kept it simple: a CLI that starts a small web server. When it receives an unauthenticated HTTP request (for now), it shuts down the machine. I also added a health check so the reverse proxy can verify whether the machine is online.</p><h1>Wakezilla</h1><p>With that in mind, I built Wakezilla, a simple tool that does exactly this: it intercepts traffic, wakes the server with WoL when needed, and powers it down when there’s no more traffic. All of this in a straightforward way, written in Rust, packaged as a single binary with no external dependencies, making it easy to use anywhere.</p><h1>Open Source Project</h1><p>The project is available on GitHub, and contributions are welcome, whether to add new features or improve documentation. If you’d like to try it out, just follow the instructions in the project’s README. If you have any questions, feel free to open an issue, and I’ll be happy to help.

I started out by installing <a href="https://ollama.com/">Ollama</a> on my Fedora (KDE Plasma DE) workstation with a Ryzen 7 5800X CPU, Radeon 6700XT GPU, and 32GB of RAM. </p><p>Initially, I had to add the following to the systemd ollama.service file to get GPU compute working properly: </p><pre><code>[Service]Environment=&quot;HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION=10.3.0&quot;</code></pre><p>Once I got that solved I was able to run the Deepseek-r1:latest model with 8-billion parameters with a pretty high level of performance. I was honestly quite surprised! </p><p>Next, I spun up an instance of Open WebUI in a podman container, and setup was very minimal. It even automatically found the local models running with Ollama. </p><p>Finally, the open-source Android app, Conduit gives me access from my smartphone. </p><p>As long as my workstation is powered on I can use my self-hosted AI from anywhere. Unfortunately, my NAS server doesn&#39;t have a GPU, so running it there is not an option for me. I think the privacy benefit of having a self-hosted AI is great. </p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section>]]></description><pubDate>Sun, 07 Sep 2025 21:15:00 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1naljd8/benefits_of_hosting_a_password_manager_in_2025_vs/</link><title>Benefits of hosting a password manager in 2025 vs Chrome's manager</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1naljd8/benefits_of_hosting_a_password_manager_in_2025_vs/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1naljd8/benefits_of_hosting_a_password_manager_in_2025_vs/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p>Reading time: 1 min | <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1naljd8/benefits_of_hosting_a_password_manager_in_2025_vs/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='separator separator-after-permalink'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='selftext'><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I went through some of the older posts and was wondering what are the benefits of hosting a password manager besides the obvious of having control of your data?</p><p>I mean so I mostly use Chrome (sometimes Firefox), have an Android phone and Chrome&#39;s internal password manager seems to work fine for the most part.

Please report unflaired content using the new report option for <a href="https://mort.cc/074fw217d25.png">Missing/Incorrect flair.</a></p><p>On the subject of Flair, if you believe a flair option is not appropriate, or if you feel a different flair option should be available, please <a href="https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/selfhosted&amp;subject=Post%20Flair%20Request">message the mods</a> and make a request. We&#39;d be happy to add new flair options if it makes sense to do so.</p><h2>Mod Applications</h2><p><strong>As of 8/11/2025, we have brought on the desired number of moderators for this round.</strong> Subreddit activity will continue to be monitored and new mods will be brought on as needed. </p><p>Thanks all!</p><p><del>Finally, we need mods. Plain and simple. The ones we have are active when they can be, but the growth of the subreddit has exceeded our team&#39;s ability to keep up with it.</del></p><p><del>The primary function we are seeking help with is mod-queue and mod mail responses.</del> </p><p><del>Ideal moderators should be kind, courteous, understanding, thick-skinned, and adaptable. We are not perfect, and no one will ever ask you to be. You will, however, need to be slow to anger, able to understand the core problem behind someone&#39;s frustration, and help solve that, rather than fuel the fire of the frustration they&#39;re experiencing.</del></p><p><del>We can help train moderators. The rules and mindset of how to handle the rules we set are fairly straightforward once the philosophy is shared. Being able to communicate well and cordially under any circumstance is the harder part; difficult to teach.</del></p><p><del><a href="https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/selfhosted&amp;subject=Moderator%20Interest">message the mods</a> if you&#39;d like to be considered. I expect to select a few this time around to participate in some mod-mail and mod-queue training, so please ensure you have a desktop/laptop that you can use for a consistent amount of time each week. Moderating from a mobile device (phone or tablet) is possible, but difficult.</del> </p><h2>Wrap Up</h2><p>Longer than average post this time around, but it has been...a while. And a lot has changed in a very short period. Especially all of this new talk about AI and its effect on the internet at large, and specifically its effect on this subreddit. </p><p>In any case, that&#39;s all for today!</p><p>We appreciate you all for being here and continuing to make this subreddit one of my favorite places on the internet. </p><p>As always, </p><p>happy (self)hosting. ;)</p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section>]]></description><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jul 2025 12:37:35 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/bsp01i/welcome_to_rselfhosted_please_read_this_first/</link><title>Welcome to /r/SelfHosted!

Taking away the &quot;unknown&quot; factor in how your data is managed and stored, this provides those with the willingness to learn and the mind to do so to take control of their data without losing the functionality of services they otherwise use frequently. </p><h2>Some Examples</h2><p>For instance, if you use dropbox, but are not fond of having your most sensitive data stored in a data-storage container that you do not have direct control over, you may consider NextCloud</p><p>Or let&#39;s say you&#39;re used to hosting a blog out of a Blogger platform, but would rather have your own customization and flexibility of controlling your updates? Why not give WordPress a go. </p><p>The possibilities are endless and it all starts here with a server. </p><h2>Subreddit Wiki</h2><p>There have been varying forms of a wiki to take place. While currently, there is no <em>officially</em> hosted wiki, we do have a <a href="https://github.com/r-selfhosted/wiki">github repository</a>. There is also at least one unofficial mirror that showcases the live version of that repo, listed on the index of the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/wiki">reddit-based wiki</a></p><h2>Since You&#39;re Here...</h2><p>While you&#39;re here, take a moment to get acquainted with our few but important <strong><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/wiki/rules">rules</a></strong></p><p>And if you&#39;re into Discord, <a href="https://discord.gg/UrZKzYZfcS">join here</a></p><p>When posting, please apply an appropriate flair to your post. If an appropriate flair is not found, please let us know! If it suits the sub and doesn&#39;t fit in another category, we will get it added! <strong><a href="https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fselfhosted">Message the Mods</a></strong> to get that started.</p><p>If you&#39;re brand new to the sub, we highly recommend taking a moment to browse a couple of our awesome self-hosted and system admin tools lists.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/Kickball/awesome-selfhosted">Awesome Self-Hosted App List</a></p><p><a href="https://github.com/n1trux/awesome-sysadmin">Awesome Sys-Admin App List</a></p><p><a href="https://github.com/veggiemonk/awesome-docker">Awesome Docker App List</a></p><p>In any case, lot&#39;s to take in, lot&#39;s to learn. Don&#39;t be disappointed if you don&#39;t catch on to any given aspect of self-hosting right away. We&#39;re available to help! </p><p>As always, happy (self)hosting!</p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section>]]></description><pubDate>Sat, 25 May 2019 06:59:15 +0530</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
