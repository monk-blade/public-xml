Even if you don&#39;t use Plex or AniList, you might find the <a href="https://github.com/eliasbenb/PlexAniBridge-Mappings">mappings database</a> this project spawned interesting.</p><p>So, I built this project because I wanted my Plex watch progress and AniList to stay in sync without manual effort - which is why I spent the last year working on something to save me a couple of minutes of effort. Anyways, I also wanted to avoid the pitfalls the existing solutions have - they either rely on fragile title search, require manual AniList to Plex mappings, or are overly simplistic and miss out on a lot of useful fields. This fixes all of that, and a lot more.</p><p>PlexAniBridge runs alongside your Plex server and keeps AniList and Plex aligned: watch status, episode progress, started/completed dates, ratings, reviews, watchlists, rewatch counts, etc. It&#39;s very customizable; it can be conservative, aggressive, or destructive if you explicitly opt in.</p><p>First of all, arguably the most impressive feature of PlexAniBridge is its <a href="https://github.com/eliasbenb/PlexAniBridge-Mappings">curated anime mappings database</a> (shoutout to <a href="https://github.com/LuceoEtzio">Luceo</a> for contributing to so much of the mappings 🤲). This database is a separate repository that contains mappings for, as of September 17, 2025, 19,916 AniList entires. For context the entire AniList database only has <a href="https://anilist.co/site-stats">~21K</a> entries. That&#39;s 94.8% coverage! The coverage is so great that title-based fuzzy search is disabled by default (but can be opted-in). In fact, my personal library has 99.98% coverage; the kicker? That stat is for episode/movie coverage - not entire shows/seasons. Yes, 99.98% of my EPISODES are mapped to AniList, including special seasons. Okay, I just had to nerd-out about that. Thank you again to Luceo on GitHub for the awesome work on this database.</p><h1>Core features</h1><ul><li>Multi-profile: you can setup multiple profiles with dozens of distinct settings and customization (maybe too much); sync different Plex servers, libraries, and accounts to different AniList users</li><li>Sync modes: you can do interval-based scans, poll for changes, or use Plex webhooks for instant updates; or any combination of those</li><li>Per-field control: Exclude any fields (e.g. score or notes) from being synced to AniList if you want to keep them separate</li><li>Web UI: there&#39;s a really nice web UI to look at sync history, stats, and manage mappings (unfortunately no web UI for configuration yet, but it&#39;s coming, hopefully)</li><li>Automatic AniList backups (JSON snapshots) + included restore functionallity through the UI or a CLI script</li><li>Undo: every sync operation is recorded with before/after state; selected operations can be undone via the UI</li><li>Custom mappings: add or override mappings through the UI or by dropping JSON files in the data dir</li><li>Smart matching: Uses a curated anime mappings DB first. Title search fallback is disabled by default; you can turn it on and control how strict (0–100 similarity threshold)</li><li>Local vs &quot;online&quot; Plex metadata mode: honestly, this feature isn&#39;t that stable, but I thought I&#39;d mention it since it&#39;s helped some users before; online mode can be used to query the Plex metadata server for when data in your local Plex server is incomplete or missing</li><li>Dockerized: easy to deploy, minimal dependencies, single container</li><li>More features to come 🔥</li></ul><h1>Nerd stuff</h1><p>Skip this if you don&#39;t care about the nitty-gritty or if you&#39;re not a nerd like me :-)</p><ul><li>Python (FastAPI + SQLAlchemy + async stack), Svelte frontend (served as a static SPA)</li><li>SQLite for internal state and history tracking</li><li>Caching layers: very intelligent caching to memoize and minimize API calls to AniList and Plex</li><li>Rate limit handling: automatic retries with backoff for AniList API limits (seriously how is it still 30 / minute in 2025)</li></ul><h1>Links</h1><ul><li>Repo: <a href="https://github.com/eliasbenb/PlexAniBridge">https://github.com/eliasbenb/PlexAniBridge</a></li><li>Docs: <a href="https://plexanibridge.elias.eu.org">https://plexanibridge.elias.eu.org</a></li><li>Mappings DB: <a href="https://github.com/eliasbenb/PlexAniBridge-Mappings">https://github.com/eliasbenb/PlexAniBridge-Mappings</a></li><li>Discord (chat/help): <a href="https://discord.gg/ey8kyQU9aD">https://discord.gg/ey8kyQU9aD</a></li></ul><p>Note: this project is intended for use with the official Plex Metadata agents. Third-party agents (e.g. HAMA) are not supported and may lead to unexpected behavior.</p><p>If this scratches the same itch for you, spin it up, run a dry run, and see if your list settles into shape.

Does it bring any significant security benefits?</p><p>Thanks!</p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section>]]></description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 23:00:21 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1niilk8/help_us_pick_an_opensource_product_to_build_in_12/</link><title>Help us pick an open-source product to build in 12 months - tell us your real pain points</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1niilk8/help_us_pick_an_opensource_product_to_build_in_12/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1niilk8/help_us_pick_an_opensource_product_to_build_in_12/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p>Reading time: 1 min | <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1niilk8/help_us_pick_an_opensource_product_to_build_in_12/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='separator separator-after-permalink'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='selftext'><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Small CS team at the university with a full year for a school project (which needs to be released as open source) wants to build and ship one useful, privacy-respecting open-source product.

We believe the actual impact of this incident is limited; however, action is required from you to ensure your account remains secure.</p><p>What happened</p><p>An unauthorized third party accessed a limited subset of customer data from one of our databases. While we quickly contained the incident, information that was accessed included emails, usernames, and securely hashed passwords.</p><p>Any account passwords that may have been accessed were securely hashed, in accordance with best practices, meaning they cannot be read by a third party. Out of an abundance of caution, we recommend you immediately reset your password by visiting <a href="https://plex.tv/reset">https://plex.tv/reset</a>. Rest assured that we do not store credit card data on our servers, so this information was not compromised in this incident.</p><p>What we&#39;re doing</p><p>We&#39;ve already addressed the method that this third party used to gain access to the system, and we&#39;re undergoing additional reviews to ensure that the security of all of our systems is further hardened to prevent future attacks.</p><p>What you must do</p><p>We kindly request that you reset your Plex account password immediately by visiting <a href="https://plex.tv/reset">https://plex.tv/reset</a>. When doing so, there&#39;s a checkbox to &quot;Sign out connected devices after password change,&quot; which we recommend you enable. This will sign you out of all your devices (including any Plex Media Server you own) for your security, and you will then need to sign back in with your new password. We understand that this means a little more work for you, but it will provide additional security to your account.</p><p>Additional Security Measures You Can TakeWe remind you that no one at Plex will ever reach out to you over email to ask for a password or credit card number for payments. For further account protection, we also recommend enabling two-factor authentication on your Plex account if you haven’t already done so.</p><p>Lastly, we sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this situation may cause you. We take pride in our security systems, which helped us quickly detect this incident, and we want to assure you that we are working swiftly to prevent potential future incidents from occurring.</p><p>For step-by-step instructions on how to reset your password, visit: <a href="https://support.plex.tv/articles/account-requires-password-reset">https://support.plex.tv/articles/account-requires-password-reset</a></p><p>Thank you,</p><p>The Plex Team</p></blockquote></div><!-- SC_ON --></section>]]></description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Sep 2025 03:00:19 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/bsp01i/welcome_to_rselfhosted_please_read_this_first/</link><title>Welcome to /r/SelfHosted!

Taking away the &quot;unknown&quot; factor in how your data is managed and stored, this provides those with the willingness to learn and the mind to do so to take control of their data without losing the functionality of services they otherwise use frequently. </p><h2>Some Examples</h2><p>For instance, if you use dropbox, but are not fond of having your most sensitive data stored in a data-storage container that you do not have direct control over, you may consider NextCloud</p><p>Or let&#39;s say you&#39;re used to hosting a blog out of a Blogger platform, but would rather have your own customization and flexibility of controlling your updates? Why not give WordPress a go. </p><p>The possibilities are endless and it all starts here with a server. </p><h2>Subreddit Wiki</h2><p>There have been varying forms of a wiki to take place. While currently, there is no <em>officially</em> hosted wiki, we do have a <a href="https://github.com/r-selfhosted/wiki">github repository</a>. There is also at least one unofficial mirror that showcases the live version of that repo, listed on the index of the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/wiki">reddit-based wiki</a></p><h2>Since You&#39;re Here...</h2><p>While you&#39;re here, take a moment to get acquainted with our few but important <strong><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/wiki/rules">rules</a></strong></p><p>And if you&#39;re into Discord, <a href="https://discord.gg/UrZKzYZfcS">join here</a></p><p>When posting, please apply an appropriate flair to your post. If an appropriate flair is not found, please let us know! If it suits the sub and doesn&#39;t fit in another category, we will get it added! <strong><a href="https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fselfhosted">Message the Mods</a></strong> to get that started.</p><p>If you&#39;re brand new to the sub, we highly recommend taking a moment to browse a couple of our awesome self-hosted and system admin tools lists.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/Kickball/awesome-selfhosted">Awesome Self-Hosted App List</a></p><p><a href="https://github.com/n1trux/awesome-sysadmin">Awesome Sys-Admin App List</a></p><p><a href="https://github.com/veggiemonk/awesome-docker">Awesome Docker App List</a></p><p>In any case, lot&#39;s to take in, lot&#39;s to learn. Don&#39;t be disappointed if you don&#39;t catch on to any given aspect of self-hosting right away. We&#39;re available to help! </p><p>As always, happy (self)hosting!</p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section>]]></description><pubDate>Sat, 25 May 2019 06:59:15 +0530</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
