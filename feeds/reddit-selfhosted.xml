If youâ€™re into self-hosting password managers, this might be worth a look.</p><p>Over the last couple of months, one of the most requested features from the selfhosted community has been a simplified installation for AliasVault. Iâ€™m excited to share that with the release of <strong>AliasVault 0.23.0</strong>, the new all-in-one Docker image is now officially available! ðŸŽ‰</p><p><strong>Website &amp; GitHub:</strong> <a href="https://www.aliasvault.net">https://www.aliasvault.net</a><br/><strong>Docs:</strong> <a href="https://docs.aliasvault.net">https://docs.aliasvault.net</a></p><p>The all-in-one Docker image makes running AliasVault much easier as it bundles all individual services (postgres, client, api, admin, smtp, task-runner, reverse-proxy) into a single Docker image using <a href="https://github.com/just-containers/s6-overlay">s6-overlay</a>. This makes it now very easy to deploy AliasVault if you:</p><ul><li>prefer a <strong>single container</strong> (instead of managing multiple)</li><li>want to run it on <strong>NAS devices</strong> like QNAP or Synology (limited platforms)</li><li>want to add it to your <strong>existing Docker host</strong> and use your own management tools like Portainer, Traefik, Caddy etc.</li></ul><p>The all-in-one container also remains <strong>fully compatible</strong> with the standard multi-container setup (using the custom install.sh). So you can switch back and forth without losing data. The new all-in-one image is now available on both ghcr.io (default) but also on Docker Hub, as the latter is often available by default on many systems like QNAP, Synology etc.</p><p>Install instructions for the all-in-one docker image can be found here: <a href="https://docs.aliasvault.net/installation/docker-compose/">https://docs.aliasvault.net/installation/docker-compose/</a></p><p>Iâ€™d love to invite everyone here on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted">r/selfhosted</a> to try it out and share your <strong>install experience</strong>. Iâ€™m happy to improve the docs based on your feedback and answer any questions you run into.</p><p>ðŸ”¹ <strong>Other recent updates to AliasVault:</strong></p><p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/p21g8iwlrdpf1.jpg?width=1440&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6fb33d18a9c9ffa813d75d6faf744cb287e16b0c">https://preview.redd.it/p21g8iwlrdpf1.jpg?width=1440&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6fb33d18a9c9ffa813d75d6faf744cb287e16b0c</a></p><ul><li>AliasVault has moved to a dedicated GitHub org â†’ <code>aliasvault/aliasvault</code></li><li>Mobile apps: configurable password generator, offline CSV export, better touch handling</li><li>UI polish: password visibility toggles, alphabetical sorting, clickable email blocks, improved admin panel</li><li>Self-hosting: reverse proxy auto-reload on SSL updates, OpenContainers annotations, CA cert support on Android</li><li>New languages (German, Finnish, Italian, Simplified Chinese â€“ thanks Crowdin contributors!)</li><li>Automatic clipboard clearing across all clients</li><li>Browser extension clickjacking mitigations</li><li>First experimental version of the all-in-one Docker image</li><li>Dropbox Passwords importer, KeePass CSV improvements, better autofill, admin panel upgrades</li></ul><p>ðŸ“œ Full changelog: <a href="https://www.aliasvault.net/news/aliasvault-0.23.0-released">https://www.aliasvault.net/news/aliasvault-0.23.0-released</a></p><p>--</p><p>Would love to hear your thoughts, install reports, or feature requests!

Itâ€™s smart enough to understand things like &quot;next Tuesday at 8 a.m.&quot; or &quot;two weeks from now on Thursday&quot; by using the recording&#39;s date as a reference. You can then export these events as a standard calendar file (.ics) and add them straight to your Google Calendar, Outlook, or whatever you use.</p><p><strong>Create your own transcript export formats</strong></p><p>I also added a new template system so you can format your exported transcripts exactly how you need them. This is really useful if you need a specific layout for meeting notes, video subtitles, or just a simple, clean text file. You can build your own templates using placeholders like <code>{{speaker}}</code> and <code>{{text}}</code>, and there are even filters to do things like make text uppercase or format timestamps correctly for SRT files.</p><p>It&#39;s all open-source and self-hostable, as always. I&#39;d love to hear what you think!</p><p><a href="https://github.com/murtaza-nasir/speakr">GitHub Repo</a> | <a href="https://murtaza-nasir.github.io/speakr">Documentation</a> | <a href="https://murtaza-nasir.github.io/speakr/screenshots">Screenshots</a></p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section><section class='preview-image'><p>&nbsp;</p><img src='https://i.redd.it/47v1zxaef0pf1.png' /></section>]]></description><pubDate>Sun, 14 Sep 2025 04:12:58 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://i.redd.it/sf6une11qzof1.jpeg</link><title>TEMPO: My self-hosted weather API (i.redd.it)</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1ng7mwp/tempo_my_selfhosted_weather_api/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1ng7mwp/tempo_my_selfhosted_weather_api/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p>Reading time: 1 min | <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1ng7mwp/tempo_my_selfhosted_weather_api/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='separator separator-after-permalink'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='selftext'><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>On the right, the excellent Windy.com; on the left, TEMPO.

This is a powerful feature that will allow users to monitor workflows (create item -&gt; get item -&gt; update item -&gt; verify item has been updated -&gt; delete item) will failsafes to ensure clean up even on failure (e.g. having the delete item step always run even if earlier steps failed). I&#39;m very excited for that feature, as I&#39;ve been wanting to implement this since Gatus was first created. It&#39;s currently on master/latest and will have to soak for some time due to the size of the changes that had to be made to the overall source code.

We believe the actual impact of this incident is limited; however, action is required from you to ensure your account remains secure.</p><p>What happened</p><p>An unauthorized third party accessed a limited subset of customer data from one of our databases. While we quickly contained the incident, information that was accessed included emails, usernames, and securely hashed passwords.</p><p>Any account passwords that may have been accessed were securely hashed, in accordance with best practices, meaning they cannot be read by a third party. Out of an abundance of caution, we recommend you immediately reset your password by visiting <a href="https://plex.tv/reset">https://plex.tv/reset</a>. Rest assured that we do not store credit card data on our servers, so this information was not compromised in this incident.</p><p>What we&#39;re doing</p><p>We&#39;ve already addressed the method that this third party used to gain access to the system, and we&#39;re undergoing additional reviews to ensure that the security of all of our systems is further hardened to prevent future attacks.</p><p>What you must do</p><p>We kindly request that you reset your Plex account password immediately by visiting <a href="https://plex.tv/reset">https://plex.tv/reset</a>. When doing so, there&#39;s a checkbox to &quot;Sign out connected devices after password change,&quot; which we recommend you enable. This will sign you out of all your devices (including any Plex Media Server you own) for your security, and you will then need to sign back in with your new password. We understand that this means a little more work for you, but it will provide additional security to your account.</p><p>Additional Security Measures You Can TakeWe remind you that no one at Plex will ever reach out to you over email to ask for a password or credit card number for payments. For further account protection, we also recommend enabling two-factor authentication on your Plex account if you havenâ€™t already done so.</p><p>Lastly, we sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this situation may cause you. We take pride in our security systems, which helped us quickly detect this incident, and we want to assure you that we are working swiftly to prevent potential future incidents from occurring.</p><p>For step-by-step instructions on how to reset your password, visit: <a href="https://support.plex.tv/articles/account-requires-password-reset">https://support.plex.tv/articles/account-requires-password-reset</a></p><p>Thank you,</p><p>The Plex Team</p></blockquote></div><!-- SC_ON --></section>]]></description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Sep 2025 03:00:19 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/bsp01i/welcome_to_rselfhosted_please_read_this_first/</link><title>Welcome to /r/SelfHosted!
