I have a pretty simple machine, an Intel i3 (4th gen) with an RTX 1650 4GB GPU not too power-hungry.</p><p>Since my GPU was underused, I decided to install <a href="https://ollama.com">Ollama</a>, a tool that allows running AI models locally. After testing Ollama, I quickly realized that 4GB wasn’t enough to run the latest models.</p><h1>Hardware Upgrade</h1><p>With this new problem, I now had the perfect excuse to upgrade my other machine the one I use for gaming. After a lot of research, I managed to get a good deal on an RX 7900 XTX. Now I have 24GB to run the latest models. But I was surprised by its power consumption, easily pulling <del>over 300 watts</del> around 45 watts in idle. This raised a red flag: keeping this machine on 24/7 would be far from energy-efficient.</p><h1>Initial Idea</h1><p>What if I had a way to power on the machine only when I needed it? I’d need another device to manage it. A Raspberry Pi would be perfect, since I could leave it running 24/7 (its power draw is minimal), and it could turn the power-hungry machine on and off.</p><h1>Wake-on-LAN</h1><p>With that in mind, I started looking into ways to remotely turn my machine on. That’s when I discovered Wake-on-LAN, or simply WoL. After configuring my motherboard and operating system, I was able to power on my machine remotely with this simple command:</p><pre><code>wakeonlan &lt;MAC_ADDRESS&gt;</code></pre><p>Because of how WoL works, it sends a “magic packet” over the local network  meaning you need to be on the same LAN to wake the machine. That’s fine, one less problem. Now I could turn the machine on remotely, which led to the next question: when do I need to power it on? The answer was simple whenever I needed to access services running on it, like Ollama or any other self-hosted service.</p><h1>Intercepting Traffic</h1><p>Most services use a specific port, such as 11434 for Ollama (where it opens a TCP connection). I thought of using a reverse proxy to intercept the traffic and, when necessary, wake the server. Once the server was online, the proxy could redirect the traffic to it. Perfect! Now we’d have the ability to wake the server remotely only when needed.</p><pre><code>sequenceDiagram    participant User as User    participant Proxy as Reverse Proxy (Wakezilla)    participant Server as Server (Ollama - port 11434)    User-&gt;&gt;Proxy: TCP Request (port 11434)    Proxy-&gt;&gt;Server: Check if online    alt Server OFF        Proxy-&gt;&gt;Server: Send Wake-on-LAN (power on server)        Server--&gt;&gt;Proxy: Server initialized    end    Proxy-&gt;&gt;Server: Redirect traffic    Server--&gt;&gt;Proxy: Response    Proxy--&gt;&gt;User: Return data</code></pre><h1>When to Shut Down the Server?</h1><p>Now that we can remotely power on the server, we also need to decide when to shut it down. I don’t want it running 24/7, so I thought, since we’re already intercepting traffic, why not monitor it? When no more requests come in, the server can be shut down. By adding a requests-per-minute threshold, if no requests are made, the server can be turned off.</p><h1>How to Do This?</h1><p>After some research, I didn’t find many tools that did exactly what I wanted, so I decided to build my own solution. Since the target machine would need some software anyway to receive the shutdown command, I kept it simple: a CLI that starts a small web server. When it receives an unauthenticated HTTP request (for now), it shuts down the machine. I also added a health check so the reverse proxy can verify whether the machine is online.</p><h1>Wakezilla</h1><p>With that in mind, I built Wakezilla, a simple tool that does exactly this: it intercepts traffic, wakes the server with WoL when needed, and powers it down when there’s no more traffic. All of this in a straightforward way, written in Rust, packaged as a single binary with no external dependencies, making it easy to use anywhere.</p><h1>Open Source Project</h1><p>The project is available on GitHub, and contributions are welcome, whether to add new features or improve documentation. If you’d like to try it out, just follow the instructions in the project’s README. If you have any questions, feel free to open an issue, and I’ll be happy to help.

I was honestly quite surprised! </p><p>Next, I spun up an instance of Open WebUI in a podman container, and setup was very minimal. It even automatically found the local models running with Ollama. </p><p>Finally, the open-source Android app, Conduit gives me access from my smartphone. </p><p>As long as my workstation is powered on I can use my self-hosted AI from anywhere. Unfortunately, my NAS server doesn&#39;t have a GPU, so running it there is not an option for me.

I also made some changes to backend/frontend communication so it becomes significantly easier to reverse proxy the app. (literally just a reverse_proxy rule to the frontend)</p><p><strong>New features</strong></p><p>- Multi-database engine support, with SQLite as default and MongoDB as alternative option</p><p>- Alternative JSON editor for bigger changes and copy/pasting</p><p>- Initial dashboard setup, will be improved upon in the future, as well as Open Telemetry integration.</p><p><strong>Improvements</strong></p><p>- Improved all input fields readability</p><p>- Frontend container is now properly communicating directly with the backend, clients dont need to interact directly with backend anymore</p><p>- When using domains that already exist in a config, combined with a template, the merging with the existing configuration doesn&#39;t break the Caddy config anymore</p><p>- Improved logging and added various cleanups throughout the codebase to improve speed</p><p><strong>Please note that the compose file has changed!</strong><br/>You can find the last version here: <a href="https://github.com/caddymanager/caddymanager/blob/0.0.2/docker-compose.yml">https://github.com/caddymanager/caddymanager/blob/0.0.2/docker-compose.yml</a> and in the readme of course!</p><p><strong>When you find a bug, please use Github issues to report it!</strong><br/><a href="https://github.com/caddymanager/caddymanager">https://github.com/caddymanager/caddymanager</a><br/>I&#39;m reading everything daily and spending at least a couple of hours each weekend going through them and roadmapping it all.</p><p>Previous post: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1lnnbo2/comment/ncax9ql/?context=1">https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1lnnbo2/comment/ncax9ql/?context=1</a></p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section>]]></description><pubDate>Sun, 07 Sep 2025 05:50:58 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1nadf1f/update_speakr_v055_your_private_audio/</link><title>[Update] Speakr v0.5.5: Your private audio transcription app gets semantic search and 5-language support</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1nadf1f/update_speakr_v055_your_private_audio/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1nadf1f/update_speakr_v055_your_private_audio/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p>Reading time: 1 min | <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1nadf1f/update_speakr_v055_your_private_audio/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='separator separator-after-permalink'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='selftext'><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Released v0.5.5 of <a href="https://github.com/murtaza-nasir/speakr">Speakr</a>, a self-hosted transcription app that converts audio into speaker diarized transcriptions and searchable organized summaries and notes.</p><p>The big addition is Inquire Mode (still experimental), which allows you to search across all recordings using natural language.

It uses semantic search to understand context, not just keyword matches. <a href="https://murtaza-nasir.github.io/speakr/screenshots">Here are some screenshots</a>.</p><p>Other notable additions are full internationalization (English, Chinese, Spanish, French, German available) and completely re-written documentation with MkDocs.</p><p>All of it runs locally with no telemetry.

Taking away the &quot;unknown&quot; factor in how your data is managed and stored, this provides those with the willingness to learn and the mind to do so to take control of their data without losing the functionality of services they otherwise use frequently. </p><h2>Some Examples</h2><p>For instance, if you use dropbox, but are not fond of having your most sensitive data stored in a data-storage container that you do not have direct control over, you may consider NextCloud</p><p>Or let&#39;s say you&#39;re used to hosting a blog out of a Blogger platform, but would rather have your own customization and flexibility of controlling your updates? Why not give WordPress a go. </p><p>The possibilities are endless and it all starts here with a server. </p><h2>Subreddit Wiki</h2><p>There have been varying forms of a wiki to take place. While currently, there is no <em>officially</em> hosted wiki, we do have a <a href="https://github.com/r-selfhosted/wiki">github repository</a>. There is also at least one unofficial mirror that showcases the live version of that repo, listed on the index of the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/wiki">reddit-based wiki</a></p><h2>Since You&#39;re Here...</h2><p>While you&#39;re here, take a moment to get acquainted with our few but important <strong><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/wiki/rules">rules</a></strong></p><p>And if you&#39;re into Discord, <a href="https://discord.gg/UrZKzYZfcS">join here</a></p><p>When posting, please apply an appropriate flair to your post. If an appropriate flair is not found, please let us know! If it suits the sub and doesn&#39;t fit in another category, we will get it added! <strong><a href="https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fselfhosted">Message the Mods</a></strong> to get that started.</p><p>If you&#39;re brand new to the sub, we highly recommend taking a moment to browse a couple of our awesome self-hosted and system admin tools lists.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/Kickball/awesome-selfhosted">Awesome Self-Hosted App List</a></p><p><a href="https://github.com/n1trux/awesome-sysadmin">Awesome Sys-Admin App List</a></p><p><a href="https://github.com/veggiemonk/awesome-docker">Awesome Docker App List</a></p><p>In any case, lot&#39;s to take in, lot&#39;s to learn. Don&#39;t be disappointed if you don&#39;t catch on to any given aspect of self-hosting right away. We&#39;re available to help! </p><p>As always, happy (self)hosting!</p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section>]]></description><pubDate>Sat, 25 May 2019 06:59:15 +0530</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
