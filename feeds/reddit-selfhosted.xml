Just wanted to share some exciting news for selfhosters üòè  ‚Äì Dockpeek has gotten a bunch of new goodies lately.</p><p>For those who don‚Äôt know, <strong>Dockpeek is a lightweight web dashboard for Docker</strong> that gives you a clear overview of all your containers and their published ports. Its main goal is to provide easy access to your services through these ports, making it super handy for managing Docker locally or across multiple hosts. Here‚Äôs the repo: <a href="https://github.com/dockpeek/dockpeek#readme">dockpeek/dockpeek</a>.</p><p>A few highlights from the latest updates:</p><ul><li><strong>New container labels:</strong> You can now use labels like <code>dockpeek.https=9001,8090</code> to force selected ports to open in HTTPS mode, and <code>dockpeek.link=https://address</code> to turn container names into clickable links ‚Äì super handy for apps behind a reverse proxy. The new <code>dockpeek.ports</code> label lets you manually define ports dockpeek should display as clickable URLs, which is especially useful for containers running with <code>--net=host</code> or on VPNs.</li><li><strong>Stack column &amp; filtering:</strong> The container table now shows a <em>Stack</em> column, so you can see which Docker Compose project each container belongs to.</li><li><strong>Improved search &amp; UI:</strong> The interface and search features have been polished, making it easier to find containers, navigate the dashboard, and interact with links. Small UI tweaks make everything cleaner and more intuitive.</li></ul><p>In short: Dockpeek is getting more flexible and easier to use. Configuring access to your services is simpler than ever ‚Äì you can enforce HTTPS, add external links, or manually set ports, and the interface makes managing containers a breeze. Check it out and let me know what you think!</p><p>Repo: <a href="https://github.com/dockpeek/dockpeek">GitHub ‚Äì dockpeek/dockpeek</a></p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section>]]></description><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2025 04:04:29 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1n8ntzb/i_wired_up_an_ai_assistant_to_my_asterisk_server/</link><title>I wired up an AI assistant to my Asterisk server so I can literally call it from any phone</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1n8ntzb/i_wired_up_an_ai_assistant_to_my_asterisk_server/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1n8ntzb/i_wired_up_an_ai_assistant_to_my_asterisk_server/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p>Reading time: 1 min | <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1n8ntzb/i_wired_up_an_ai_assistant_to_my_asterisk_server/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='separator separator-after-permalink'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='selftext'><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I‚Äôve been tinkering on a personal side project I call <em>Afriend</em> ‚Äî basically a self-hosted AI that lives on my home linux server and acts like a phone contact I can dial.</p><p>The stack looks like this:</p><ul><li><strong>Asterisk + Callcentric SIP</strong> for the telephony backbone</li><li><strong>AGI/ARI integration</strong> to capture audio and control playback</li><li><strong>Whisper</strong> for transcription (running locally on GPU)</li><li><strong>Mistral/LLM</strong> for responses (served via FastAPI)</li><li><strong>Coqui TTS</strong> for generating the voice</li><li>Hardware: <strong>HP DL380 Gen10</strong> w/ dual Xeon + NVIDIA T4 &amp;

button/option next to any song, album or artist using the awesome AudioMuse AI project with the included Jellyfin Plugin (<a href="https://github.com/NeptuneHub/AudioMuse-AI">https://github.com/NeptuneHub/AudioMuse-AI</a>) Note: AudioMuse AI can also do dynamic playlists, but I found the experience much easier with JellyJams for this<br/>Grabs metadata from MusicBrainz and Discogs (Apple Music is also an option for those who would prefer it)</p><p>Player support is great!<br/>The two options I have been most impressed with is the excellent open source Jellyfin music app Jellify which recently got an Android release (Already been on iOS for some time) (<a href="https://github.com/Jellify-Music/App?tab=readme-ov-file">https://github.com/Jellify-Music/App?tab=readme-ov-file</a>) and Symphonium has a direct login option for Jellyfin as well!<br/>All of the listed services are available via docker or docker-compose making deployment easy, and the plugins for Jellyfin are all easy to configure via the Jellyfin GUI once you&#39;ve added the repositories.  </p><p>This stack, at least with what I have tried so far has been the easiest and most complete feeling replacement to a traditional  streaming service I have tried. You can also hook up a service like Explo to dynamically download music for you automatically based on your ListenBrainz listens if you&#39;re into that: (<a href="https://github.com/LumePart/Explo">https://github.com/LumePart/Explo</a>)</p><p>Hopefully this helps someone with their self-hosted music journey!</p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section>]]></description><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2025 01:58:54 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1n8dvpg/selfhosting_in_a_disaster/</link><title>Self-hosting in a disaster</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1n8dvpg/selfhosting_in_a_disaster/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1n8dvpg/selfhosting_in_a_disaster/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p>Reading time: 1 min | <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1n8dvpg/selfhosting_in_a_disaster/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='separator separator-after-permalink'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='selftext'><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Yesterday my area had a level 1 evacuation notice (&quot;be ready&quot;), and I spent about six hours shoving all my important stuff in my car.

But let&#39;s dig into some changes we can start working with.</p><h2>AI-Related Content</h2><p>First and foremost, the official subreddit stance:</p><p><strong><em><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted">/r/selfhosted</a> allows the sharing of tools, apps, applications, and services, assuming any post related to AI follows all other subreddit rules</em></strong></p><p>Here are some updates on how posts related to AI are to be handled from here on, though. </p><p>For now, there seem to be 4 major classifications of AI-related posts. </p><ol><li>Posts <em>written</em> with AI. </li><li>Posts about vibe-coded apps with minimal/no peer review/testing</li><li>AI-built apps that otherwise follow industry standard app development practices</li><li>AI-assisted apps that feature AI as part of their function. </li></ol><p><strong><em>ALL 4 ARE ALLOWED</em></strong></p><p>I will say this again. None of the above examples are disallowed on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted">/r/selfhosted</a>. If someone elects to use AI to write a post that they feel better portrays the message they&#39;re hoping to convey, that is their perogative. Full-stop. </p><p>Please stop reporting things for &quot;AI-Slop&quot; (inb4 a bajillion reports on this post for AI-Slop, unironically). </p><p>We do, however, require flair for these posts. In fact...</p><h2>Flair Requirements</h2><p>We are now enforcing flair across the board. Please report unflaired content using the new report option for <a href="https://mort.cc/074fw217d25.png">Missing/Incorrect flair.</a></p><p>On the subject of Flair, if you believe a flair option is not appropriate, or if you feel a different flair option should be available, please <a href="https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/selfhosted&amp;subject=Post%20Flair%20Request">message the mods</a> and make a request. We&#39;d be happy to add new flair options if it makes sense to do so.</p><h2>Mod Applications</h2><p><strong>As of 8/11/2025, we have brought on the desired number of moderators for this round.</strong> Subreddit activity will continue to be monitored and new mods will be brought on as needed. </p><p>Thanks all!</p><p><del>Finally, we need mods. Plain and simple. The ones we have are active when they can be, but the growth of the subreddit has exceeded our team&#39;s ability to keep up with it.</del></p><p><del>The primary function we are seeking help with is mod-queue and mod mail responses.</del> </p><p><del>Ideal moderators should be kind, courteous, understanding, thick-skinned, and adaptable. We are not perfect, and no one will ever ask you to be. You will, however, need to be slow to anger, able to understand the core problem behind someone&#39;s frustration, and help solve that, rather than fuel the fire of the frustration they&#39;re experiencing.</del></p><p><del>We can help train moderators. The rules and mindset of how to handle the rules we set are fairly straightforward once the philosophy is shared. Being able to communicate well and cordially under any circumstance is the harder part; difficult to teach.</del></p><p><del><a href="https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/selfhosted&amp;subject=Moderator%20Interest">message the mods</a> if you&#39;d like to be considered. I expect to select a few this time around to participate in some mod-mail and mod-queue training, so please ensure you have a desktop/laptop that you can use for a consistent amount of time each week. Moderating from a mobile device (phone or tablet) is possible, but difficult.</del> </p><h2>Wrap Up</h2><p>Longer than average post this time around, but it has been...a while. And a lot has changed in a very short period. Especially all of this new talk about AI and its effect on the internet at large, and specifically its effect on this subreddit. </p><p>In any case, that&#39;s all for today!</p><p>We appreciate you all for being here and continuing to make this subreddit one of my favorite places on the internet. </p><p>As always, </p><p>happy (self)hosting. ;)</p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section>]]></description><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jul 2025 12:37:35 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/bsp01i/welcome_to_rselfhosted_please_read_this_first/</link><title>Welcome to /r/SelfHosted!

Taking away the &quot;unknown&quot; factor in how your data is managed and stored, this provides those with the willingness to learn and the mind to do so to take control of their data without losing the functionality of services they otherwise use frequently. </p><h2>Some Examples</h2><p>For instance, if you use dropbox, but are not fond of having your most sensitive data stored in a data-storage container that you do not have direct control over, you may consider NextCloud</p><p>Or let&#39;s say you&#39;re used to hosting a blog out of a Blogger platform, but would rather have your own customization and flexibility of controlling your updates? Why not give WordPress a go. </p><p>The possibilities are endless and it all starts here with a server. </p><h2>Subreddit Wiki</h2><p>There have been varying forms of a wiki to take place. While currently, there is no <em>officially</em> hosted wiki, we do have a <a href="https://github.com/r-selfhosted/wiki">github repository</a>. There is also at least one unofficial mirror that showcases the live version of that repo, listed on the index of the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/wiki">reddit-based wiki</a></p><h2>Since You&#39;re Here...</h2><p>While you&#39;re here, take a moment to get acquainted with our few but important <strong><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/wiki/rules">rules</a></strong></p><p>And if you&#39;re into Discord, <a href="https://discord.gg/UrZKzYZfcS">join here</a></p><p>When posting, please apply an appropriate flair to your post. If an appropriate flair is not found, please let us know! If it suits the sub and doesn&#39;t fit in another category, we will get it added! <strong><a href="https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fselfhosted">Message the Mods</a></strong> to get that started.</p><p>If you&#39;re brand new to the sub, we highly recommend taking a moment to browse a couple of our awesome self-hosted and system admin tools lists.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/Kickball/awesome-selfhosted">Awesome Self-Hosted App List</a></p><p><a href="https://github.com/n1trux/awesome-sysadmin">Awesome Sys-Admin App List</a></p><p><a href="https://github.com/veggiemonk/awesome-docker">Awesome Docker App List</a></p><p>In any case, lot&#39;s to take in, lot&#39;s to learn. Don&#39;t be disappointed if you don&#39;t catch on to any given aspect of self-hosting right away. We&#39;re available to help! </p><p>As always, happy (self)hosting!</p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section>]]></description><pubDate>Sat, 25 May 2019 06:59:15 +0530</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
