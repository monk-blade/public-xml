I don&#39;t recall what caused me to think of it, but I found myself wondering &quot;I wonder if all the disk write caches are enabled?&quot;  As it turns out -- they weren&#39;t (this was taken after -- sde/sdu were previously set to &#39;off&#39;).  Here&#39;s a handy little script to check that and get the output above:</p><p>for d in /dev/sd*; do</p><p># Only block devices with names starting with &quot;sd&quot; followed by letters, and no partition numbers</p><p>[[ -b $d ]] || continue</p><p>if [[ $d =~ ^/dev/sd[a-z]+$ ]]; then</p><p>fw=$(sudo smartctl -i &quot;$d&quot; 2&gt;/dev/null | awk -F: &#39;/Firmware Version/{gsub(/ /,&quot;&quot;,$2); print $2}&#39;)</p><p>wc=$(sudo hdparm -W &quot;$d&quot; 2&gt;/dev/null | awk -F= &#39;/write-caching/{gsub(/ /,&quot;&quot;,$2); print $2}&#39;)</p><p>printf &quot;%-6s Firmware:%-6s WriteCache:%s\n&quot; &quot;$d&quot; &quot;$fw&quot; &quot;$wc&quot;</p><p>fi</p><p>done</p><p>Two new disks I just bought had their write caches disabled on arrival.  Also had a tough time getting them to flip, but this was the command that finally did it: &quot;smartctl -s wcache-sct,on,p /dev/sdX&quot;. I had only added one to the pool as a replacement so far, and it was choking the entire resilver process.  My scan speed shot up 10x, and issue speed jumped like 40x.</p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section><section class='preview-image'><p>&nbsp;</p><img src='https://i.redd.it/h6rvcgq8tzpf1.png' /></section><section class='separator separator-before-comments'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='comments'><p>Top comment</p><ol><li><div class="md"><p>On NVMe you can use this to figure out if writecache is enabled or not:</p><pre><code>cat /sys/block/nvme0n1/queue/write_cache</code></pre><p>write-through means disabled and write-back means enabled.</p><p>Note however that enabling writecache can be a very bad thing if your box isnt connected to an UPS.</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/Proxmox/comments/1nl01y5/lesson_learned_make_sure_your_write_caches_are/nf1vb30/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p></li></ol></section>]]></description><pubDate>Fri, 19 Sep 2025 16:07:05 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/Proxmox/comments/1nkfjvm/new_to_promox_is_proxmox_full_course_by_learn/</link><title>New to Promox - is Proxmox Full Course by Learn Linux TV still up to date for beginners?</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/Proxmox/comments/1nkfjvm/new_to_promox_is_proxmox_full_course_by_learn/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/Proxmox/comments/1nkfjvm/new_to_promox_is_proxmox_full_course_by_learn/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p>Reading time: 1 min | <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/Proxmox/comments/1nkfjvm/new_to_promox_is_proxmox_full_course_by_learn/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='separator separator-after-permalink'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='selftext'><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi folks,</p><p>As title says, new to Proxmox and want to follow a youtube guide.

I can definitely work as it is right now, but I know it can be better, especially considering these machines are all within the same LAN.</p><p>I&#39;ve used Windows machines hosted on AWS that felt as if I was running that OS natively on the client, so I know it is possible, I just don&#39;t know what I need to make that happen.</p><p>Do I need a GPU for this? If so, I know it doesn&#39;t have to be terribly powerful, but I&#39;m wondering if there is a preferred make/model for this type of use case, preferably something that does not consume a ton of power at idle and is compact. I have a 4U chassis and am running an i5 13600K and the VM has 16 GB RAM assigned to it.</p><p>Any advice is greatly appreciated.</p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section><section class='separator separator-before-comments'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='comments'><p>Top comments</p><ol><li><div class="md"><p>13th gen iGPU has srv-io support so should be able to pass the igpu through the VM and also use with other VMs and iGPU.</p><p>Some people the gpu through to an external monitor but not sure how that will go srv-io/GPI so you&#39;ll need that can host Sunshine to allow a remote collection</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/Proxmox/comments/1niwsdy/gpu_for_remote_desktop/nem1s48/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><div class="md"><p>I tested a configuration on Windows 10 pro this week, and once the installation is complete with all VirtIO driver installed including VirtIO-GPU.</p><p>After this passed through the GPU to the windows VM, Installed drivers from the console, rebooted and tadam.
