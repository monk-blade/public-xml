Tried extensively in hopes I could save money using the old servers we had while I was testing Proxmox at work before we migrate in the future, I&#39;ve had filesystem corruption more times than I could count (at least 10-15 times), and it was a nightmare to troubleshoot given it loved to break in a different way most times. Tried on two Poweredge FC630s and one R720, tried getting replacement VFlash cards (refurbished of course, no shot I&#39;d spend more than 20 bucks testing something that&#39;s clearly not likely to succeed), happened again. The longest I think I&#39;ve had one work for is a week at most, mostly dies when doing updates. Proxmox has a lot of logging though so even if you don&#39;t update it, you probably won&#39;t have long. Sometimes I could save it, most times I couldn&#39;t. All times it wasn&#39;t worth the effort. </p><p>Really just putting this here so some poor soul on google trying to make the most of old hardware they got for cheap/free avoids spending the time I did on this. I&#39;ve tested exhaustively pretty exhaustively so you don&#39;t have to. Wouldn&#39;t even recommend for a temporary install. The most I&#39;d use it for is learning how to install it and stopping there, because boy did I learn setting it up well after the first 10 times.</p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section>]]></description><pubDate>Sat, 13 Sep 2025 02:10:50 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/Proxmox/comments/1nf2k52/wrote_a_proxmox_hardening_guide_looking_for/</link><title>Wrote a Proxmox Hardening Guide - looking for feedback &amp;amp; testing</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/Proxmox/comments/1nf2k52/wrote_a_proxmox_hardening_guide_looking_for/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/Proxmox/comments/1nf2k52/wrote_a_proxmox_hardening_guide_looking_for/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p>Reading time: 1 min | <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/Proxmox/comments/1nf2k52/wrote_a_proxmox_hardening_guide_looking_for/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='separator separator-after-permalink'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='selftext'><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi y’all,<br/>I’ve released a Proxmox hardening guide (PVE 8 / PBS 3) that extends the CIS Debian 12 benchmark with Proxmox specific tasks.<br/><strong>Repo:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/HomeSecExplorer/Proxmox-Hardening-Guide">https://github.com/HomeSecExplorer/Proxmox-Hardening-Guide</a>  </p><p>A few controls are <strong>not</strong> yet validated and are marked accordingly.<br/>If you have a lab and can verify the unchecked items (see the README ToDos), I’d appreciate your results and feedback.  </p><p>Planned work: PVE 9 and PBS 4 once the CIS Debian 13 benchmark is available.  </p><p><strong>Feedback is very welcome!</strong><br/>Thanks!</p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section>]]></description><pubDate>Fri, 12 Sep 2025 18:28:53 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/Proxmox/comments/1nf1v7t/some_positive_feedback_about_upgrading_from_v8_to/</link><title>Some positive feedback about upgrading from v8 to v9</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/Proxmox/comments/1nf1v7t/some_positive_feedback_about_upgrading_from_v8_to/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/Proxmox/comments/1nf1v7t/some_positive_feedback_about_upgrading_from_v8_to/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p>Reading time: 1 min | <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/Proxmox/comments/1nf1v7t/some_positive_feedback_about_upgrading_from_v8_to/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='separator separator-after-permalink'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='selftext'><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Yesterday, I upgraded my Proxmox VE server from v8 to v9 and my Proxmox Backup Server from v3 to v4 without any issues.

I had numerous LXC&#39;s I&#39;d set up over time some with Proxmox Helper scripts, others I struggled manually installing. It was painful, especially when every tutorial I would find about selfhosting something there would be tons of tutorials for docker and not much about manually installing. </p><p>Yesterday I thought its time to do it. Setup a fresh Ubuntu Server VM, Installed Docker then portainer. Portainer is brilliant, I&#39;ve never used it. I have used docker containers for years with unRaid so I&#39;m used to have a GUI to manage them but Portainer gives you a lot more! </p><p>As I start moving over my containers to docker, has anyone else done this move? Any tips or recommendations? I have backups in Proxmox setup already. I&#39;m looking forward to have just 1 server I SSH to manage all my containers and now with a nice GUI (Portainer) to go with it. First pain point I&#39;m finding is trying to backup my Nginx Proxy Manager data to move, it that&#39;s even possible. Leading upto this journey I&#39;ve been diving more into Linux than I ever have before, its just awesome.</p><p>Even started to use my Github account now, setup a private repo to push my docker compose up to. </p><p>Edit: Very interesting replies on this post making me question now what to do haha.. Going to digest this over the weekend to decide what route to go. Thanks all! </p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section>]]></description><pubDate>Fri, 12 Sep 2025 03:21:55 +0530</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
