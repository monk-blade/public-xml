I connect to the Windows instance using Chrome Remote Desktop, not the best but it works flawlessly.

My setup includes three <strong>HP ProLiant DL360</strong> servers with 10Gb network cards. The PBS itself is running on a custom PC with the following specifications:  </p><ul><li><strong>CPU:</strong> Ryzen 7 8700G</li><li><strong>RAM:</strong> 128GB DDR5</li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 4x 14TB HDDs in a RAIDZ2 ZFS pool, and 3x 128GB NVMe SSDs for cache</li><li><strong>Motherboard:</strong> ASUS X670E-E</li><li><strong>Network:</strong> 10Gb Ethernet card</li></ul><p>The issue I&#39;m facing is that my backups are running at a very curious speed of <strong>133MB/s</strong>. This speed seems to be capped at what you would expect from a 1Gb link, yet my entire internal Proxmox network is running at 10Gb.  </p><p>Currently, the PBS is not in production, so I have the flexibility to run further tests with my ZFS setup.  </p><p><strong>Versions:</strong>  </p><ul><li><strong>Proxmox:</strong> 8.4.13</li><li><strong>PBS:</strong> 4.0.14</li></ul><p><strong>Tests Performed:</strong>I have already created a separate ZFS pool using only the NVMe drives to rule out any HDD bottlenecks, but the speeds remain the same at 133MB/s. I&#39;m looking for guidance on what could be causing this 1Gb speed cap in a 10Gb network environment.  </p><p>I currently have a Debian-based NAS with a PC and RAID cards for my standard vzdump backups. These are already in production, and the copy speed consistently stays around 430MB/s.
