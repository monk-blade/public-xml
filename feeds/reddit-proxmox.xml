Like an idiot, I made some snap purchases of new hardware that are not on the VMWare HCL so I&#39;ve decided to make the switch to Proxmox and have built a 2-node cluster that is attached to my existing two TrueNAS iSCSI targets.</p><p>I&#39;m going to start moving workloads from my VMWare cluster to my Proxmox cluster but before I do I want to learn from those who have gone before: what gotchas did you discover? I would hate to migrate my set of workloads off of servers on my VMWare cluster and start tearing things down only to discover Some Thing that forces me to rethink the way I&#39;ve done my deployment or worse, forces me to tear down and rebuild my new cluster because I&#39;ve unknowingly backed myself into a corner.</p><p>I&#39;m intentionally not going the Ceph route yet as my two TrueNas boxes are rock solid and have a lot of life left in them. Eventually I&#39;ll retire them for Ceph storage but I&#39;m very comfortable with iSCSI and don&#39;t want to move away from it just yet. I&#39;ve got enough on my plate and my credit card already cries from the two Proxmox node purchases I&#39;ve already made.</p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section>]]></description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Sep 2025 08:08:00 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://i.redd.it/ltpdsx31sqnf1.png</link><title>I'm always running low on RAM, so I wrote a script to quickly see which VM/LXC is the culprit (i.redd.it)</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/Proxmox/comments/1nasrvd/im_always_running_low_on_ram_so_i_wrote_a_script/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/Proxmox/comments/1nasrvd/im_always_running_low_on_ram_so_i_wrote_a_script/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p>Reading time: 1 min | <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/Proxmox/comments/1nasrvd/im_always_running_low_on_ram_so_i_wrote_a_script/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='separator separator-after-permalink'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='selftext'><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all, I&#39;m relatively RAM-constrained on my proxmox host, so wanted a way to get a quick visual of where the consumption is going.

Hadn’t had a reason to create a fresh Ubuntu VM until today.  Creating Debian VMs works fine, tried a TrueNAS scale and a Home Assistant OS one.  No issues.  Can create a ubuntu VM using cloud-init if I want to.  But I don’t want to.  Using both 22.04 and 24.04 ISO’s, Ubuntu server install fails either when downloading a security update or installing the kernel.   </p><p>Most often says “internal server error” and lists the ipv6 address of the host.  However, it’s done a lot already that implies DNS is resolving and it’s getting access to archive.ubuntu.org.  If I go to shell from the installer I can ping, curl just fine to all sorts of addresses including archive.ubuntu.org.  But it fails in one of the two places here - either explicitly failed, or just hanging (I’ve included a screenshot of explicit failure, the hang happens after dozens of Get files from us.archive.ubuntu.com on a big Linux firmware file (537mb).  True whether I use q35 or i1440fx, SeaBIOS or UEFI, qemu or not, SCSI or SATA, whether I have ipv6 enabled on the host or not (by setting inet6 on vmbr0 to manual in /etc/network/interfaces), CPU type is x86-64-v2-AES or host, balooning device or not.  I’ve tried a lot of permutations.  Anyone else experiencing this?  Anyone have any bright ideas?</p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section><section class='preview-image'><p>&nbsp;</p><img src='https://i.redd.it/751tvans7nnf1.jpeg' /></section>]]></description><pubDate>Sun, 07 Sep 2025 06:40:05 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/Proxmox/comments/1na2dub/debian_container_doesnt_boot_after_the_131_update/</link><title>Debian container doesn't boot after the 13.1 update</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/Proxmox/comments/1na2dub/debian_container_doesnt_boot_after_the_131_update/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/Proxmox/comments/1na2dub/debian_container_doesnt_boot_after_the_131_update/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p>Reading time: 1 min | <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/Proxmox/comments/1na2dub/debian_container_doesnt_boot_after_the_131_update/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='separator separator-after-permalink'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='selftext'><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Just a head up to warn that my debian lxc container doesn&#39;t boot anymore after the update from 13.0 to 13.1</p><p>Here is the error message :</p><pre><code>run_buffer: 571 Script exited with status 25lxc_init: 845 Failed to run lxc.hook.pre-start for container &quot;100&quot;__lxc_start: 2034 Failed to initialize container &quot;100&quot;</code></pre><p>I couldn&#39;t find a solution with google, just an unrelated old problem with binutils, I restored the CT from a backup, but I think it&#39;s caused by the update of systemd</p><p><strong>Edit</strong> : after more research on a test CT, it seems it&#39;s not the update of systemd inside the CT but the version 13.1 that is not supported by the starting script:</p><pre><code>DEBUG    utils - ../src/lxc/utils.c:run_buffer:560 - Script exec /usr/share/lxc/hooks/lxc-pve-prestart-hook 109 lxc pre-start produced output: unsupported debian version &#39;13.1&#39;</code></pre><p><strong>Edit 2</strong> : yep, it was that after changing the line 39 of the file /usr/share/perl5/PVE/LXC/Setup/Debian.pm</p><p>from</p><pre><code>die &quot;unsupported debian version &#39;$version&#39;\n&quot; if !($version &gt;= 4 &amp;&amp; $version &lt;= 13);</code></pre><p>to</p><pre><code>die &quot;unsupported debian version &#39;$version&#39;\n&quot; if !($version &gt;= 4 &amp;&amp; $version &lt;= 14);</code></pre><p>and the container starts again.</p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section>]]></description><pubDate>Sat, 06 Sep 2025 20:57:24 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/Proxmox/comments/1n9v62e/how_much_overhead_does_proxmox_add/</link><title>how much overhead does proxmox add?</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/Proxmox/comments/1n9v62e/how_much_overhead_does_proxmox_add/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/Proxmox/comments/1n9v62e/how_much_overhead_does_proxmox_add/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p>Reading time: 1 min | <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/Proxmox/comments/1n9v62e/how_much_overhead_does_proxmox_add/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='separator separator-after-permalink'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='selftext'><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Compared to something like HYPER-V on windows (where i need a windows instance as well so thats not a waste), how much performance overhead do i lose on prox mox, and is it better to run things through proxmox or just to use them natively on windows ( all the stuff i want to run is already on windows and any stuff that is not has docker containers and wsl2 can run portainer soo..?)</p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section>]]></description><pubDate>Sat, 06 Sep 2025 14:54:02 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/Proxmox/comments/1n9s6m1/ext4_or_zfs_for_pve_installation/</link><title>ext4 or zfs for PVE installation?</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/Proxmox/comments/1n9s6m1/ext4_or_zfs_for_pve_installation/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/Proxmox/comments/1n9s6m1/ext4_or_zfs_for_pve_installation/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p>Reading time: 1 min | <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/Proxmox/comments/1n9s6m1/ext4_or_zfs_for_pve_installation/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='separator separator-after-permalink'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='selftext'><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have a single SSD on which I am installing PVE.</p><p>Does it make sense to use ZFS (raid0 with only one disk)?</p><p>Why: I have another computer with OPNsense on it.

But it was fun getting it set up and I don&#39;t have to worry about running out of resources. </p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section><section class='embedded-media'><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/om248u6envmf1.png?width=1591&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c545addb03124a18e84613d85fc52ae829f9236d" height="495" width="1591" /></p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/3stoto8envmf1.jpg?width=1310&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4a9727f5178742b28e3fe5ae0b7b082281f668de" height="1834" width="1310" /></p></section>]]></description><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 10:14:49 +0530</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
