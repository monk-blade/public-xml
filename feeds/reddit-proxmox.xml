While I used Docker to deploy my services, I had no backup strategy and relied on a single SSD boot drive and one 10 TB mechanical drive for my media and Linux ISOs. This past summer, I decided to replace the aging, power-hungry PC with a mini PC. Since I was starting fresh, I took a serious look at Proxmox. I had known about it but never really understood the benefits compared to running everything directly on bare metal, or in my case, one server sharing and serving dozens of services through a mix of native installs and Docker.</p><p>Fast forward to today, I’ve been running Proxmox for several months, added a 4x24 TB DAS to my mini PC, and now everything runs in separate LXC containers, except for one VM that uses Podman to deploy all my *arr and media-related services.</p><p>The reason I’m making this post is because I just experienced firsthand why hypervisors like Proxmox, and backups, are so incredible. One of my services had a corrupted database. All I had to do was open Proxmox, select the VM, go to backups, browse the VM disk, grab the .DB file from a working backup, upload it to the VM, and I was back up and running. I actually had this same service fail in the past, but without backups I had to reconfigure everything from scratch. While I know this could have been solved before with proper backups, Proxmox and PBS make backup automation, management, and restores so simple that it pushed me to take backups more seriously.</p><p>Beyond that, everything about my Proxmox journey has been very positive (aside from my small gripes with VMIDs). It has completely changed how I see server management. I even replaced my cloud VPS with a dedicated server, so now all my public-facing cloud services run on Proxmox too.</p><p>I’m really happy with the product and very appreciative that such a high-quality piece of software is available for free and I’m very thankful to all the developers who work on it and the large community around it supporting each other.</p><p>Lastly, one day I hope to convince my team at work to move from VMware to Proxmox, but that’s for another day.</p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section>]]></description><pubDate>Tue, 02 Sep 2025 21:16:36 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/Proxmox/comments/1n649jl/upgrading_from_546_to_more_modern_versions/</link><title>Upgrading from 5.4-6 to more modern versions?</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/Proxmox/comments/1n649jl/upgrading_from_546_to_more_modern_versions/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/Proxmox/comments/1n649jl/upgrading_from_546_to_more_modern_versions/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p>Reading time: 1 min | <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/Proxmox/comments/1n649jl/upgrading_from_546_to_more_modern_versions/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='separator separator-after-permalink'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='selftext'><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey all, Currently running 5.4-6 on an old install that&#39;s been silently chugging away in a closet.
