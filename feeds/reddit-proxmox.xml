Tried extensively in hopes I could save money using the old servers we had while I was testing Proxmox at work before we migrate in the future, I&#39;ve had filesystem corruption more times than I could count (at least 10-15 times), and it was a nightmare to troubleshoot given it loved to break in a different way most times. Tried on two Poweredge FC630s and one R720, tried getting replacement VFlash cards (refurbished of course, no shot I&#39;d spend more than 20 bucks testing something that&#39;s clearly not likely to succeed), happened again. The longest I think I&#39;ve had one work for is a week at most, mostly dies when doing updates. Proxmox has a lot of logging though so even if you don&#39;t update it, you probably won&#39;t have long. Sometimes I could save it, most times I couldn&#39;t. All times it wasn&#39;t worth the effort. </p><p>Really just putting this here so some poor soul on google trying to make the most of old hardware they got for cheap/free avoids spending the time I did on this. I&#39;ve tested exhaustively pretty exhaustively so you don&#39;t have to. Wouldn&#39;t even recommend for a temporary install. The most I&#39;d use it for is learning how to install it and stopping there, because boy did I learn setting it up well after the first 10 times.</p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section>]]></description><pubDate>Sat, 13 Sep 2025 02:10:50 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/Proxmox/comments/1nf2k52/wrote_a_proxmox_hardening_guide_looking_for/</link><title>Wrote a Proxmox Hardening Guide - looking for feedback &amp;amp; testing</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/Proxmox/comments/1nf2k52/wrote_a_proxmox_hardening_guide_looking_for/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/Proxmox/comments/1nf2k52/wrote_a_proxmox_hardening_guide_looking_for/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p>Reading time: 1 min | <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/Proxmox/comments/1nf2k52/wrote_a_proxmox_hardening_guide_looking_for/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='separator separator-after-permalink'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='selftext'><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi y‚Äôall,<br/>I‚Äôve released a Proxmox hardening guide (PVE 8 / PBS 3) that extends the CIS Debian 12 benchmark with Proxmox specific tasks.<br/><strong>Repo:</strong>¬†<a href="https://github.com/HomeSecExplorer/Proxmox-Hardening-Guide">https://github.com/HomeSecExplorer/Proxmox-Hardening-Guide</a>  </p><p>A few controls are¬†<strong>not</strong>¬†yet validated and are marked accordingly.<br/>If you have a lab and can verify the unchecked items (see the README ToDos), I‚Äôd appreciate your results and feedback.  </p><p>Planned work: PVE 9 and PBS 4 once the CIS Debian 13 benchmark is available.  </p><p><strong>Feedback is very welcome!</strong><br/>Thanks!</p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section>]]></description><pubDate>Fri, 12 Sep 2025 18:28:53 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/Proxmox/comments/1nf1v7t/some_positive_feedback_about_upgrading_from_v8_to/</link><title>Some positive feedback about upgrading from v8 to v9</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/Proxmox/comments/1nf1v7t/some_positive_feedback_about_upgrading_from_v8_to/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/Proxmox/comments/1nf1v7t/some_positive_feedback_about_upgrading_from_v8_to/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p>Reading time: 1 min | <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/Proxmox/comments/1nf1v7t/some_positive_feedback_about_upgrading_from_v8_to/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='separator separator-after-permalink'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='selftext'><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Yesterday, I upgraded my Proxmox VE server from v8 to v9 and my Proxmox Backup Server from v3 to v4 without any issues.

Setup a fresh Ubuntu Server VM, Installed Docker then portainer. Portainer is brilliant, I&#39;ve never used it.

Leading upto this journey I&#39;ve been diving more into Linux than I ever have before, its just awesome.</p><p>Even started to use my Github account now, setup a private repo to push my docker compose up to. </p><p>Edit: Very interesting replies on this post making me question now what to do haha.. Going to digest this over the weekend to decide what route to go. Thanks all! </p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section>]]></description><pubDate>Fri, 12 Sep 2025 03:21:55 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://forum.proxmox.com/threads/proxmox-datacenter-manager-0-9-beta-released.171741/#post-800084</link><title>Proxmox Data Center Manager beta 0.9 released (forum.proxmox.com)</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/Proxmox/comments/1nech9u/proxmox_data_center_manager_beta_09_released/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/Proxmox/comments/1nech9u/proxmox_data_center_manager_beta_09_released/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p>Reading time: 6 min | <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/Proxmox/comments/1nech9u/proxmox_data_center_manager_beta_09_released/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='preview-image'><img src='https://forum.proxmox.com/styles/uix/images/Proxmox-logo-stacked-white-background-1200.png' /></section><section class='parsed-content'><div><article><div><p>After months of hard work and collaboration with our community, we are thrilled to release the beta version of Proxmox Datacenter Manager. This version is based on the great Debian 13 "Trixie" and comes with a 6.14.11 Kernel as stable default and ZFS 2.3.4.</p><p>Note: The current release of Proxmox Datacenter Manager 0.9 is a beta version.</p><p><b>Here are some of the highlights of the Proxmox Datacenter Manager 0.9 Beta version</b></p><ul> <li>EVPN configuration for Software-Defined Networking between clusters from a single interface</li> <li>Improved search functionality to find resources more quickly</li> <li>More efficient metric collection logic</li> <li>Privilege Management for Proxmox Datacenter Manager users from the access control UI</li> <li>Seamless upgrade from Proxmox Datacenter Manager Alpha</li> </ul><p><b>What's Proxmox Datacenter Manager?</b><br> The Datacenter Manager project has been developed with the objective of providing a centralized overview of all your individual nodes and clusters. It also enables basic management like migrations of virtual guests without any cluster network requirements.</p><p>The project is fully developed in the Rust programming language, from the backend API server to the CLI tools to a completely new frontend. The frontend is built on the new widget toolkit that we developed over the last few years. This offers a more modern web user interface experience, not only in terms of appearance and functionality, but also in terms of accessibility, speed, and compatibility.</p><p><b>Installation &amp; Usage</b><br> See our in-progress documentation for how to install and configure your own Proxmox Datacenter Manager:<br> <a href="https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Proxmox_Datacenter_Manager_Beta_Documentation#First_Steps_with_Proxmox_Datacenter_Manager_%E2%80%93_Mini_Howto">https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Proxmo..._with_Proxmox_Datacenter_Manager_&ndash;_Mini_Howto</a></p><p><b>What&rsquo;s Next?</b><br> The beta phase will continue until the first stable release is available.<br> After prioritizing our new major releases and establishing a solid foundation based on Debian Trixie, we significantly increased development activity for PDM and plan to release the first stable version later this year.<br> Stay tuned for updates as we move toward the first stable release!</p><p><b>Release notes</b><br> <a href="https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Proxmox_Datacenter_Manager_Roadmap">https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Proxmox_Datacenter_Manager_Roadmap</a></p><p><b>Download</b><br> <a href="https://enterprise.proxmox.com/iso">https://enterprise.proxmox.com/iso</a></p><p><b>Community Forum</b><br> <a href="https://forum.proxmox.com">https://forum.proxmox.com</a></p><p><b>Bugtracker</b><br> <a href="https://bugzilla.proxmox.com">https://bugzilla.proxmox.com</a></p><p><b>Source code</b><br> <a href="https://git.proxmox.com">https://git.proxmox.com</a></p><p><b>Join the Discussion</b><br> We&rsquo;d love to hear your impressions and answer any questions. Let&rsquo;s start a conversation in this thread or connect in our new forum to report bugs, suggest features, or share your thoughts. You can check the roadmap to see if your idea is already being tracked.</p><p><b>FAQ</b><br> <b>Q</b>: Can I upgrade from the Proxmox Datacenter Manager Alpha to this Beta version?<br> <b>A</b>: Yes, please follow our guide here: <a href="https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Proxmox_Datacenter_Manager_Upgrade_from_Alpha_to_Beta">https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Proxmox_Datacenter_Manager_Upgrade_from_Alpha_to_Beta</a></p><p><b>Q</b>: How does this integrate into Proxmox Virtual Environment?<br> <b>A</b>: You can add arbitrary Proxmox VE hosts or clusters as remotes. Proxmox Datacenter Manager will then monitor them and provide basic management using only the API.</p><p><b>Q</b>: How many different Proxmox VE hosts and/or cluster can I manage with a single PDM instance?<br> <b>A</b>: Due to the early stage of development, there are still some pain points, but we are confident that we will be able to handle large setups with a moderate amount of resources. We have run tests with over 5000 remotes and over 10000 virtual guests to confirm the performance expectations of our new UI framework. We are targeting similar numbers for the backend.</p><p><b>Q</b>: What Proxmox VE version is supported?<br> <b>A</b>: The minimum required Proxmox VE version is 8. We will support all actively supported Proxmox VE releases, but encourage frequent upgrades of both PDM and PVE as new features are often developed in lockstep.</p><p><b>Q</b>: Will other Proxmox projects be supported?<br> <b>A</b>: Yes, support for Proxmox Backup Server is planned, for other Proxmox projects (Mail Gateway, Offline Mirror) we will see how they can be integrated after the first stable release of Proxmox Datacenter Manager.</p><p><b>Q</b>: What environment does Proxmox Datacenter Manager support?<br> <b>A</b>: Proxmox Datacenter Manager will work everywhere where a standard x86-64/AMD64 Debian system is supported.</p><p><b>Q</b>: Is there any recommended system requirements for the Proxmox Datacenter Manager?<br> <b>A</b>: Yes, see <a href="https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Proxmox_Datacenter_Manager_Beta_Documentation#Minimum_System_Requirements">https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Proxmo...eta_Documentation#Minimum_System_Requirements</a></p><p><b>Q</b>: Can I upgrade to the latest Proxmox Datacenter Manager Beta with apt?<br> <b>A</b>: Yes, first ensure you have basic Debian repositories and the <code>pdm-test</code> repository setup.<br> Then you can use either the built-in updates UI or use the standard <code>apt update</code> and <code>apt full-upgrade</code> commands.</p><p><b>Q</b>: Can I install Proxmox Datacenter Manager alongside with Proxmox VE or Proxmox Backup Server?<br> <b>A</b>: Yes, but installing alongside other Proxmox projects is not the recommended setup (expert use only).</p><p><b>Q</b>: What network setups are supported between Proxmox Datacenter Manager and remotes?<br> <b>A</b>: In general the Proxmox Datacenter Manager needs to be able to connect to all Proxmox VE remotes directly to send API requests and query load and usage metrics. Remotes on the other hand do not need to be able to connect to Datacenter Manager directly. Reverse proxies between Proxmox Datacenter Manager and any of its Proxmox VE remotes are not supported, we recommend using tunneling (for example, WireGuard or OpenVPN) for hosts that must not be exposed directly to a non-private network.</p><p><b>Q</b>: Where can I get more information about feature updates?<br> <b>A</b>: Check the <a href="https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Proxmox_Datacenter_Manager_Roadmap">roadmap</a>, <a href="https://forum.proxmox.com/">forum</a>, the <a href="https://lists.proxmox.com/">mailing list</a>, and/or subscribe to our <a href="https://www.proxmox.com/en/news">newsletter</a>.</p></div></article> </div></section>]]></description><pubDate>Thu, 11 Sep 2025 21:24:11 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/Proxmox/comments/1nebeez/first_time_doing_complete_restore_process_success/</link><title>First time doing complete restore process (success)</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/Proxmox/comments/1nebeez/first_time_doing_complete_restore_process_success/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/Proxmox/comments/1nebeez/first_time_doing_complete_restore_process_success/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p>Reading time: 2 min | <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/Proxmox/comments/1nebeez/first_time_doing_complete_restore_process_success/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='separator separator-after-permalink'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='selftext'><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello,</p><p>I recently posted about how my Proxmox server died quietly in the night (working with minisforum RMA) and while that will probably take some time, I needed to get my primary services back online. I had a smaller weaker server (4 core, 16gb ram) box sitting in the closet so I figured it would be a good time to test the restore process.</p><p>The prior setup was a NAB9 with 64 GB of ram, 1tb HD mini PC running Proxmox. Pretty simple. I also have a ubiquiti NAS. I ran PBS as a VM in Proxmox. In PBS I connected it to my NAS over NFS for its datastore. All backups were stored on my NAS. Then in Proxmox, I connected it to the NAS via NFS and created a datastore there just for backups. For general backups, PBS backed up all my VMS/LXC except for itself, to the NFS share. On Proxmox, it only backed up the PBS VM, once again to the NFS share that it had access to. </p><p>It made sense on paper but I&#39;ve never had to do a complete restore before. Until today.</p><p>I created a USB drive of Proxmox 9 (why not upgrade version while doing this). I installed it on the new (old) mini pc and spun it up. I then connected Proxmox to my NAS over NFS and made sure to select backups as the option for the datastore. It immediately saw the PBS backups. I was then able to restore the PBS VM.</p><p>Once the PBS VM was restored, I booted it up with no issues. I then had to reconnect it to the NFS share where the PBS datastore was (for some reason autofs didn&#39;t work). It immediately saw all the backups for all the other VMs. </p><p>Then all I had to do was reconnect PBS to Proxmox, and I was able to restore my critical VMs after reducing memory/core quantity. </p><p>Ive always held the belief that PBS needed its own hardware but this backup solution worked great.</p><p>Figured I would give some real world options for homelabbers. </p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section>]]></description><pubDate>Thu, 11 Sep 2025 20:41:23 +0530</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
