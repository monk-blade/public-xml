(Yes, these security rules exist, I have no idea why.) My question is, would it benefit my Windows install at all to pass the unused iGPU through to it? I&#39;ve had it running without it for ages now, but it occured to me today that I could pass the iGPU through. Is it worth the effort though? I connect to the Windows instance using Chrome Remote Desktop, not the best but it works flawlessly. The Windows VM is deployed on a small Beelink MiniPC with an Intel N100 CPU and has 3 of the 4 cores available to it, but shared with a Docker VM instance that runs a few lightweight containers. </p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section><section class='separator separator-before-comments'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='comments'><p>Top comments</p><ol><li><div class="md"><p>If you are using Chrome Remote Desktop, passing the iGPU would not improve your desktop user experience much.

As you have almost 150GB of ram available it could be buffering all the I/O and then when it gets to 100% waiting for the disk system to catch up.  I noticed this on my servers with 1TB of RAM....  You might want to try tuning these two values on the proxmox host:<br/>echo 134217728 &gt; /proc/sys/vm/dirty_background_bytes  # 128MB<br/>echo 536870912 &gt; /proc/sys/vm/dirty_bytes            # 512MB</p><p>to cap how far ahead I/O can get.  I have fairly fast NVMe drives on the server these are set, so even these might be too bit large if your disk cant&#39; flush 512MB in a couple of seconds.  Setting these will not impact total time much, but will help to keep getting transfers to buffers in memory from getting too far ahead of disks.</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/Proxmox/comments/1nhs2rs/restoring_vm_crazy_slow/neelfij/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><div class="md"><p>What’s your storage setup for the Proxmox node and the backup source?</p><p>How big is the VM?</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/Proxmox/comments/1nhs2rs/restoring_vm_crazy_slow/nedou06/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p></li></ol></section>]]></description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 22:52:09 +0530</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
