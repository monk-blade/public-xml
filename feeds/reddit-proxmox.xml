Restoring old backups (e.g., when migrating from HyperV to Proxmox) fails because Veeam can&#39;t create the disks. This is caused by the VM version 10, which is the default version for VMs.  </p><p><strong>What&#39;s the workaround I&#39;m presenting here?</strong></p><p>The configuration of the new VM in Proxmox has to be &quot;manipulated&quot; at the right moment, because you can&#39;t influence Veeam&#39;s ability to always try to create a V10 VM. This isn&#39;t possible via the GUI because the VM is locked (CREATE LOCK).</p><p>Using ChatGPT, I created a small tool that waits for a new VM to be created (you have to specify the ID; Veeam always uses the next available ID) and then immediately downgrades the version to 9.2.

Hadn’t had a reason to create a fresh Ubuntu VM until today.  Creating Debian VMs works fine, tried a TrueNAS scale and a Home Assistant OS one.  No issues.  Can create a ubuntu VM using cloud-init if I want to.  But I don’t want to.  Using both 22.04 and 24.04 ISO’s, Ubuntu server install fails either when downloading a security update or installing the kernel.   </p><p>Most often says “internal server error” and lists the ipv6 address of the host.  However, it’s done a lot already that implies DNS is resolving and it’s getting access to archive.ubuntu.org.  If I go to shell from the installer I can ping, curl just fine to all sorts of addresses including archive.ubuntu.org.  But it fails in one of the two places here - either explicitly failed, or just hanging (I’ve included a screenshot of explicit failure, the hang happens after dozens of Get files from us.archive.ubuntu.com on a big Linux firmware file (537mb).  True whether I use q35 or i1440fx, SeaBIOS or UEFI, qemu or not, SCSI or SATA, whether I have ipv6 enabled on the host or not (by setting inet6 on vmbr0 to manual in /etc/network/interfaces), CPU type is x86-64-v2-AES or host, balooning device or not.  I’ve tried a lot of permutations.  Anyone else experiencing this?
