My setup includes three <strong>HP ProLiant DL360</strong> servers with 10Gb network cards. The PBS itself is running on a custom PC with the following specifications:  </p><ul><li><strong>CPU:</strong> Ryzen 7 8700G</li><li><strong>RAM:</strong> 128GB DDR5</li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 4x 14TB HDDs in a RAIDZ2 ZFS pool, and 3x 128GB NVMe SSDs for cache</li><li><strong>Motherboard:</strong> ASUS X670E-E</li><li><strong>Network:</strong> 10Gb Ethernet card</li></ul><p>The issue I&#39;m facing is that my backups are running at a very curious speed of <strong>133MB/s</strong>. This speed seems to be capped at what you would expect from a 1Gb link, yet my entire internal Proxmox network is running at 10Gb.  </p><p>Currently, the PBS is not in production, so I have the flexibility to run further tests with my ZFS setup.  </p><p><strong>Versions:</strong>  </p><ul><li><strong>Proxmox:</strong> 8.4.13</li><li><strong>PBS:</strong> 4.0.14</li></ul><p><strong>Tests Performed:</strong>I have already created a separate ZFS pool using only the NVMe drives to rule out any HDD bottlenecks, but the speeds remain the same at 133MB/s. I&#39;m looking for guidance on what could be causing this 1Gb speed cap in a 10Gb network environment.  </p><p>I currently have a Debian-based NAS with a PC and RAID cards for my standard vzdump backups. These are already in production, and the copy speed consistently stays around 430MB/s. This makes me believe the problem is not a network performance issue, but rather something related to the PBS configuration.</p><p>Please I need help, don&#39;t know what I am missing.  </p><p>Thank you in advance for your help!  </p><p>PD: PBS Benchmarks results attached</p><p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/5rfhlhlzwipf1.png?width=487&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4a1e44ab7b620e1b5d7b1f7c54bb2a728e9c1ef">https://preview.redd.it/5rfhlhlzwipf1.png?width=487&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4a1e44ab7b620e1b5d7b1f7c54bb2a728e9c1ef</a></p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section><section class='separator separator-before-comments'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='comments'><p>Top comments</p><ol><li><div class="md"><p>It&#39;s probably your HDDs.  You really need SSD for PBS because of the deduplication on PBS it needs all flash if you want decent backup and restore speeds.  Run <code>iostat -dx 1</code>  (if needed install the sysstat package), and monitor the % utilization of your hard drives.  If at least one of them is constantly at the 90+% utill% during backup, that is your bottleneck.</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/Proxmox/comments/1niglke/pbs_4_slow_backup/neip2vt/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><div class="md"><p>Can you post part of your backup log?  Where exactly are you seeing the 133MB/s reported?  Normally you should see a read and write speed, and if it&#39;s slow on the read speed during backup then it&#39;s likely the speed of your PVE host storage (or it&#39;s CPU at it&#39;s used for compression) and not the PBS server.</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/Proxmox/comments/1niglke/pbs_4_slow_backup/nen32bj/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><div class="md"><p>Long shot but have you tried playing within the advanced tab on the backup job on PVE ?
