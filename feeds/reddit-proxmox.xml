(Yes, these security rules exist, I have no idea why.) My question is, would it benefit my Windows install at all to pass the unused iGPU through to it? I&#39;ve had it running without it for ages now, but it occured to me today that I could pass the iGPU through. Is it worth the effort though? I connect to the Windows instance using Chrome Remote Desktop, not the best but it works flawlessly. The Windows VM is deployed on a small Beelink MiniPC with an Intel N100 CPU and has 3 of the 4 cores available to it, but shared with a Docker VM instance that runs a few lightweight containers. </p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section><section class='separator separator-before-comments'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='comments'><p>Top comments</p><ol><li><div class="md"><p>If you are using Chrome Remote Desktop, passing the iGPU would not improve your desktop user experience much.

I borked my cluster trying to remove a node. Great thing about proxmox is that you can reinstall over and restore all the VMs &amp; LXCs from pbs in minutes. Only complicated thing is restoring mount points on the host and the gpu settings - I’m hoping that my pbs backups of /etc help me out if i ever blow away my big box instead of one of my mini pc’s.</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/Proxmox/comments/1nhfhc9/help_removed_cluster_now_vms_and_lxc_are_not/nebhdhq/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><div class="md"><p>Did you remove the second, failed node first? </p><p>Also, I&#39;m not sure if <code>rm -R /etc/pve/nodes</code> was the right call, since even a standalone node will put it&#39;s configs there. </p><p>So basically you removed all the VM/LXC config files. I think they will work until you reboot the host, then they won&#39;t start since there is no config file to go off of. But I might be wrong here. </p><p>You can try to recreate the VMs and attach the existing VM drives/LXC disks. This should work, as long as you can somehow figure out which disk belongs to which VM/LXC. Or you just recreate them by ID first and once you know what&#39;s what clone them to rename them to whatever they were before.</p><p>In short: not completely screwed, but depending on the amount of guests we&#39;re talking about, you&#39;ll spend some time on recovery.</p><p>Edit: also check the linked thread, you&#39;re not the only one, so there are solutions further down, right after someone claimed <code>rm -rf /etc/pve/nodes</code> would be a good idea.</p></div><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/Proxmox/comments/1nhfhc9/help_removed_cluster_now_vms_and_lxc_are_not/nebbezs/'><small>Comment permalink</small></a></p></li></ol></section>]]></description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 13:04:35 +0530</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
