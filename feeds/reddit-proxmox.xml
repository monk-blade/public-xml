I have a separate bare metal box for Windows Server 2022 as a file server (for this important role, I didn&#39;t want to virtualize it and the hardware is so inexpensive these days).  </p><p>What role does a NAS play in your home lab situation (i.e. not a production environment)?  </p><p>I run &quot;only&quot; gigabit networking (not 2.5 or anything faster).  So I&#39;m not planning to have my VMs on a NAS.  Currently all the VMs are on an NVME disk (non-raid) internal to each Proxmox box and I don&#39;t think I need to change that.  Performance has been zippy and I don&#39;t need super-high availability.</p><p>I could see myself storing the data (photos and media) on the NAS though and that could have redundant storage because the data would be important.</p><p>More questions:</p><p>1) Does it matter what OS is used for the NAS?  I ask because I&#39;m very comfortable with Windows and I feel that a Windows Server box is very stable and performant. </p><p>2)  Would I have any problems having Promox and it&#39;s VMs store their data (not the VM OS) on the Windows Server that is functionally a NAS?  As hinted in my opening line, I&#39;m very much a Linux noob.  I would love to continue to use my existing Windows Server &quot;NAS&quot; and not erect a new more &quot;Linux-oriented&quot; NAS.</p><p>I do want to learn about Proxmox Backup Server.  And I read with interest recently about how someone has PBS running as a VM on their TrueNAS box.  I should have asked him about how he found that combination.  Anyhow, I&#39;m hoping I can use my Windows Server as the target &quot;disk&quot; for PBS backups initially, though I do relish the opportunity to learn about TrueNAS.</p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section>]]></description><pubDate>Thu, 11 Sep 2025 01:52:22 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://i.redd.it/rvzz1g7szdof1.jpeg</link><title>Failed node in two node cluster (i.redd.it)</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/Proxmox/comments/1ndnh1j/failed_node_in_two_node_cluster/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/Proxmox/comments/1ndnh1j/failed_node_in_two_node_cluster/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p>Reading time: 1 min | <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/Proxmox/comments/1ndnh1j/failed_node_in_two_node_cluster/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='separator separator-after-permalink'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='selftext'><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Woke up to no internet at the homelab and saw this after trying to reboot my primary proxmox host. </p><p>I have two hosts in what I thought was a redundant config but I’m guessing I didn’t have ceph set up all the way.

I tried to use the proxmox advanced options and tried both kernel options, and no change. I created  a proxmox  usb drive and tried to do a rescue, more kernel panics.

The only reason I wonder if it is network related is that I had a similar problem a few months back with my work laptop. It would drop the connection overnight, and I&#39;d have to disable/enable the ethernet adapter to reconnect or restart the laptop. That went away on the laptop, but now it is here on my Proxmox box.</p><p>It&#39;s also worth mentioning that I did set up a cronjob to keep my freemyip DDNS updated, and that cronjob coincides with the issue.

This is caused by the VM version 10, which is the default version for VMs.  </p><p><strong>What&#39;s the workaround I&#39;m presenting here?</strong></p><p>The configuration of the new VM in Proxmox has to be &quot;manipulated&quot; at the right moment, because you can&#39;t influence Veeam&#39;s ability to always try to create a V10 VM. This isn&#39;t possible via the GUI because the VM is locked (CREATE LOCK).</p><p>Using ChatGPT, I created a small tool that waits for a new VM to be created (you have to specify the ID; Veeam always uses the next available ID) and then immediately downgrades the version to 9.2. This makes the restore work!</p><p>I hope this script might help others as well.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/fqfr/veeam-proxmox-workaround/tree/main">https://github.com/fqfr/veeam-proxmox-workaround/tree/main</a></p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section>]]></description><pubDate>Sun, 07 Sep 2025 19:49:40 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://i.redd.it/ltpdsx31sqnf1.png</link><title>I'm always running low on RAM, so I wrote a script to quickly see which VM/LXC is the culprit (i.redd.it)</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/Proxmox/comments/1nasrvd/im_always_running_low_on_ram_so_i_wrote_a_script/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/Proxmox/comments/1nasrvd/im_always_running_low_on_ram_so_i_wrote_a_script/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p>Reading time: 1 min | <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/Proxmox/comments/1nasrvd/im_always_running_low_on_ram_so_i_wrote_a_script/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='separator separator-after-permalink'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='selftext'><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all, I&#39;m relatively RAM-constrained on my proxmox host, so wanted a way to get a quick visual of where the consumption is going.

Hadn’t had a reason to create a fresh Ubuntu VM until today.  Creating Debian VMs works fine, tried a TrueNAS scale and a Home Assistant OS one.  No issues.  Can create a ubuntu VM using cloud-init if I want to.  But I don’t want to.  Using both 22.04 and 24.04 ISO’s, Ubuntu server install fails either when downloading a security update or installing the kernel.   </p><p>Most often says “internal server error” and lists the ipv6 address of the host.  However, it’s done a lot already that implies DNS is resolving and it’s getting access to archive.ubuntu.org.  If I go to shell from the installer I can ping, curl just fine to all sorts of addresses including archive.ubuntu.org.  But it fails in one of the two places here - either explicitly failed, or just hanging (I’ve included a screenshot of explicit failure, the hang happens after dozens of Get files from us.archive.ubuntu.com on a big Linux firmware file (537mb).  True whether I use q35 or i1440fx, SeaBIOS or UEFI, qemu or not, SCSI or SATA, whether I have ipv6 enabled on the host or not (by setting inet6 on vmbr0 to manual in /etc/network/interfaces), CPU type is x86-64-v2-AES or host, balooning device or not.  I’ve tried a lot of permutations.  Anyone else experiencing this?  Anyone have any bright ideas?</p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section><section class='preview-image'><p>&nbsp;</p><img src='https://i.redd.it/751tvans7nnf1.jpeg' /></section>]]></description><pubDate>Sun, 07 Sep 2025 06:40:05 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/Proxmox/comments/1na9v6k/quick_snapshot_questions_for_proxmox_users/</link><title>Quick snapshot questions for Proxmox users</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/Proxmox/comments/1na9v6k/quick_snapshot_questions_for_proxmox_users/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/Proxmox/comments/1na9v6k/quick_snapshot_questions_for_proxmox_users/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p>Reading time: 1 min | <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/Proxmox/comments/1na9v6k/quick_snapshot_questions_for_proxmox_users/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='separator separator-after-permalink'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='selftext'><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’d like to hear how others approach snapshots in Proxmox, since I imagine there are different workflows and tricks:</p><ol><li>Do you typically delete snapshots immediately after confirming changes, or do you keep a few around in case?</li><li>Have you encountered any issues with snapshots — for example, during VM migration or with specific storage backends?</li></ol><p>Curious to hear what works best for you.</p></div><!-- SC_ON --></section>]]></description><pubDate>Sun, 07 Sep 2025 01:56:10 +0530</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/Proxmox/comments/1na9thz/trouble_updating_containers/</link><title>Trouble updating containers</title><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/Proxmox/comments/1na9thz/trouble_updating_containers/</guid><comments>https://www.reddit.com/r/Proxmox/comments/1na9thz/trouble_updating_containers/</comments><description><![CDATA[<section class='reading-time-and-permalink'><p>Reading time: 1 min | <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/Proxmox/comments/1na9thz/trouble_updating_containers/'>Post permalink</a></p></section><section class='separator separator-after-permalink'><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section class='selftext'><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I just updated to Proxmox 9 and decided it was a good time to get my various containers up to date as well.  </p><p>The updates go fine and at the end I reboot the container just to confirm that everything worked and I&#39;m met with this error each time: </p><blockquote><p>run_buffer: 571 Script exited with status 25</p></blockquote><p>After some googling I find that error is indicating there isn&#39;t enough storage space on the virtual disk.
